This has turned into a weight loss sub,"I joined thus sub for support and info on PCOS, but I feel I will be leaving soon. I understand weight/body image struggle is something many of us experience and how someone else feels about their body is their own business, not mine. 

But (there's always a but) I feel like nearly every post turns to the topic of weight loss and how hard it is. I am now coming across posts of people with healthy BMIs posting about how they hate their bodies and how fat they feel. 

Again, not trying to police anyone's experiences, but I am in ED recovery and seeing weights lower than mine called disgusting is not where I need to be. Since the responsibility for viewing my own triggers is on me, I will be taking my leave. I wish you all the best, and I do not wish to attack anyone, just share and hopefully start a healthy and respectful discussion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/th1l25/this_has_turned_into_a_weight_loss_sub/,565,1647610852.0,/r/PCOS/comments/th1l25/this_has_turned_into_a_weight_loss_sub/
I'm now free of the curse,"My PCOS evolved into ovarian cancer and after months of chemo my end of treatment on Wednesday was a full hysterectomy. I'm on hrt now and already feeling the effects. Including the immediate stop of one of my least favourite PCOS symptoms, hot flashes. The random sweating has been the bane of my existence since puberty. I haven't had a single hot flash since yesterday, only chills coming from cold, winter air, and any hot from the efficiency of my heater and warmth of my blankets. Recovery from the surgery is painful, but manageable with Tylenol. Now to heal and wait to hear back from the doctors to see if the pathology results are clear.

TIL we are at higher risk of vit D deficiency AND it affects us more.,"I am VERY sore and I was looking up reasons (btw we are also more prone to soreness bc of an insane amount of reasons too lol) and found the link between vit D and PCOS. 

Went down the rabbit hole but basically:

**Its harder for us:**

>Research suggests that up to 70–85% of people with PCOS are deficient in vitamin D, even if they live in sunny climates.

> PCOS can impair vitamin D metabolism due to chronic inflammation and insulin resistance, making it harder to absorb and utilize effectively.



**But also more important:**

Deficiency in vitamin D can worsen the key symptoms of PCOS, including:

**a) Insulin Sensitivity (elevated blood sugar levels, fat storage, and worsened androgen imbalances, *even in lean individuals*)**

> Vitamin D enhances the activity of insulin receptors, improving glucose uptake and reducing insulin resistance.

**b) Androgen Levels (acne, hirsutism, and hair loss)**

Vitamin D regulates androgen production by reducing luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, which are often elevated in PCOS.


**c) Inflammation (worsens other PCOS symptoms, impairs recovery from exercise AND  increases risk of heart disease)**

>Vitamin D has anti-inflammatory properties and may reduce markers of inflammation like C-reactive protein (CRP).


**d) Weight Management (hormonal and metabolic imbalances)**

>Adequate vitamin D levels may improve fat metabolism and appetite regulation, aiding in weight management.


**e) Menstrual Cycles (irregular or absent periods, ovulation issues)**

> Vitamin D supports healthy ovulation and progesterone production, helping regulate cycles.


**f) Mental Health**
> PCOS is often associated with anxiety and depression, potentially worsened by vitamin D deficiency, which plays a role in serotonin production and mood regulation.


Every day I learn something new about PCOS and I hate it. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.

Edit: Ways to get enough are obviously thorugh supplementation but also enough sunlight (I just got one of those lamps and I was already noticing benefits!), avoiding calcium overload (guilty) and magnesium supplementation!

FINALLY! 30lbs down. *Trigger Warning - weight + ED*,"Y'all, I have been trying to prioritize managing my PCOS for the last several years. With that, I *need* to lose weight. 

It's been a struggle to lose weight (shocker) in a healthy manner and I have started recovery and been trying to manage my ED (bulimia). 

It's taken a year but I have finally lost 30lbs in a healthy, sustainable way. 😭

Prioritizing protein + moving my body more (really just increasing steps vs hardcore exercise). 

It's been slow. I know it could be quicker but I need slow for my recovery. I still have a long way to go but I am really proud of myself for this. 

I just needed to share my joy with someone who understands how freaking hard this is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/15sorxj/finally_30lbs_down_trigger_warning_weight_ed/,223,1692189524.0,/r/PCOS/comments/15sorxj/finally_30lbs_down_trigger_warning_weight_ed/
"I'm down 5 pounds in a month and I don't feel hungry, I don't starve myself, and I'm so happy with it.","I know that people want to see weight loss much higher than 1lb a week. But I also knew that with PCOS, recovery from an eating disorder and being my first weight loss journey, that this could be a really difficult battle. Not to mention, I'm 5'3, my 500 cal deficit is only 1300, and any less I would worry about deficiencies. 

I was so worried I wouldn't lose any weight at all because of everyone's struggle I hear about here. 
For a month the scale didn't budge, and I was starting to lose hope until a week after that point when I dropped 2, then 5 pounds total. I know its not much, but it means I'm actually losing at a normal rate, and I definitely have insulin resistance, my doctors told me, and I was getting terrible symptoms from eating carbs or sugar before my diet change. It turns out, sugar stays in your system for 3 months, so I had 3 months of high sugar backed up in my system, so any more made me feel ill. I was constantly hungry and constantly having sugar cravings, I was well on my way to diabetes. This is why I had to make the change.

🩷 What I did 🩷

Just a regular, 500 cal deficit. 
(Anymore could have led to high cortisol, slow metabolism and deficiency) 

Intermittent Fasting 
(To help lower insulin and help me to feel full and still be able to have voluminous meals) 16:8

Low sugar, Low carb diet
(Without totally restricting these, I didn't cut out any foods, just lowered them, but a small sugar fast helped lower my overall blood sugar levels so now I can eat sugar without feeling sick) 

I balance my meals. I have less carbs, but I always make sure to include healthy fats and protein in good amounts. This makes sure my meal is satisfying and delicious. Delicious food is absolutely a key here.

No high intensity cardio, just finding every excuse to walk every day. No more grocery delivery, I walk and get it in person whenever I run out instead of all at once. 

Resistance Training 3x a week, unless I am too fatigued in which case I trust my body. 

A Strong Green Tea for caffeine, every morning. Unless I'm specifically resting. This helps me to be more active, get more done, without feeling jittery and stressed.

♡

I don't take any supplements. I simply can't afford it and I don't plan to start. I have taken actual liquid ACV in the past but it was too gross to keep drinking.

I do believe all of these things helped. And it didn't feel like doing too much. I got used to each of them. Intermittent Fasting comes naturally now and helps me personally so much to meet my calorie goal, just because of the way I work as a person. I no longer experience symptoms from eating sugar/carbs, I no longer crave them but will eat sugar sometimes and carbs in moderation. (I was tested for diabetes and it was negative, by the way) I have energy all day. I rest when I need it. I have refeed days up to 
maintenence when I feel I need it. I don't have cheat meals because I don't need them. I've met my calorie goal every day and I never feel like I'm starving. I'm more full than before. 

Edit: Personally intermittent fasting actually matches really well with my inner cycle of when I naturally want to eat food. It makes me much less stressed, it was hard for me to need to eat food all through the day. And calorie counting is to help me eat enough, not just too much! 

I am just happy that I am able to lose weight at a normal rate without unsustainable changes and I want people to see that it isnt a weight loss death sentence if you have PCOS. I believe that taking an approach where I find my diet quite easy to stick to, it doesn't feel like a chore, I enjoy the foods and don't eat at a crazy deficit, this means my cortisol doesn't go high or might even be lowered which I think contributes way more to weight gain than we think. This is just my theory. I don't believe it's just luck as my insulin resistance was a real problem previously. I feel much healthier now.

I'm going to continue as I am and hope to see more progress. 

Edit: Also I forgot to mention! I just got my first regular period. In combination with the combined pill, this is the first period I've had that was consecutive, and not extremely long. I even experience it in a typical way, no PMMD and weird mood stuff.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1b7y5ne/im_down_5_pounds_in_a_month_and_i_dont_feel/,154,1709727043.0,/r/PCOS/comments/1b7y5ne/im_down_5_pounds_in_a_month_and_i_dont_feel/
"I have to choose between a healthy weight & an eating disorder, apparently?","I have struggled for YEARS trying to tell people that I have to eat less than the average person to maintain the same weight, with people very rarely believing me. I gained weight all throughout high school, despite a healthy diet specialized for PCOS prescribed by my gynecologist + ~2 sports at any given time.

My first year of college, I was sick of it and kept cutting down more and more. I ended up developing an eating disorder where I was snacking once a day. Only then did I begin to lose any weight. I went down from dangerously close to ""obese"" to a ""healthy weight"". My mental health absolutely suffered for this. I've been in back & forth in recovery for over a year now, and my weight has also fluctuated.

Recently I've wanted to become stronger, so this morning I checked out the FAQ on r/xxfitness and found this linked study about decreased BMR in people w/ PCOS. In some ways, it's a relief to finally see, but right now I'm just really frustrated. And I know that many people can do OMAD without disordered thinking, but I can't. I feel like I need to choose between mental & physical health.

Sorry for the long-winded, rambly, negative post. I swear I'm usually more positive about my PCOS diagnosis, but the downer thoughts are the ones that want to get out & be heard, y'know?

Where are my people with Binge Eating Disorder 😌,"Soo I had BED growing up, been in recovery for the past 3 years. Feels like so much of it was physical cravings (undiagnosed insulin resistance) + for dopamine (undiagnosed ADHD) that a majority of the triggers went away when I become medicated for that and PCOS…but there was still that emotional component, how I would eat when I was stressed/upset/overwhelmed. Even if it wasn’t as “obvious” as eating ice cream straight out of the pint, maybe just taking too much food at dinner because it tastes so good.

Working on still healing my relationship w food but I still struggle from time to time, just wondering on where the overlap of people on here w BED & PCOS is.

My 3 year PCOS acne transformation from right before I was diagnosed to now!,"https://m.imgur.com/a/scj6oaf

I’ve been on and off this sub for years reading and relating and now that I’ve finally figured out my pcos acne I thought maybe I could help someone else or provide a light at the end of the tunnel for anyone else who’s starting where I started three years ago.

I was diagnosed at 20 after stopping the birth control that I was on since I was 16, I just didn’t like how it made me feel. However, that birth control was masking my pcos symptoms, so when I stopped taking it all hell broke loose. I blew up in multiple ways, my weight, my skin, my mood. What finally prompted me to go to the doctor was my period. Unlike the common symptom of pcos which is lack of a period, I had my period every other week for 4 months...how my body could bleed that much who knows. 
After some tests it was confirmed. She started me on a birth control tailored towards pcos, making sure I didn’t throw my hormones even more out of wack and the healing began.

What I did for my cystic acne:
- I would was with a salicylic acid wash and exfoliant (I know sounds brutal but when it was this aggressive and producing new zits every day I needed to have rapid skin turn over)
- I would follow that up with witch hazel soak, helps calm inflammation and redness
- I would then add on bag balm, a mild antiseptic cream, to calm pustulates even more and prevent bacterial growth and spread of acne
- I started removing added sugars and grains, and no dairy.

After 8-10 months my skin had calmed a bit but still was more aggressive than your average acne and I still had the trademark hair loss of pcos. That’s when I was prescribed spironolactone, this I believe was my game changer.

After another six months I was basically acne free, yes I had to rely on medications to get there but I’ve never felt so great. All that was remaining were acne scars, which I treated by exfoliating, retinol oil, moisturizer and sunscreen!

That’s where I am today, a long road to skin recovery and restoration of my self-esteem. Every step was worth it. I get zits here and there and it brings me joy seeing them as normal blemishes most girls face and not the cystic mounds I was use to. Hopefully my story to recovery can provide some hope that those nights of frustration and constantly trying to better your symptoms are worth it.  I still suffer from other aspects of pcos like the insulin sensitivity, hair growth/hair loss, but I’m sure with time those will come around!

Picture was on what I thought was a good day for my acne, couldn’t bare taking pictures on the regular days.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/d91zi5/my_3_year_pcos_acne_transformation_from_right/,142,1569411212.0,/r/PCOS/comments/d91zi5/my_3_year_pcos_acne_transformation_from_right/
Eating disorder and PCOS: Relapse appears inevitable,"No clear objective by writing this post. Mostly just trying to process, and wondering if anyone feels the same and could offer empathy.

I’m looking at a likely diagnosis of PCOS. I don’t fit the standard for a PCOS candidate — I am normal weight, but I’ll have anywhere from like 40 to 65 days between periods, my blood tests revealed elevated DHEAS, I’m on the higher end of normal for AFC, and my testosterone was right on the very edge of “normal”. I recently had a pelvic ultrasound conducted and I’m still waiting on my doctor’s interpretation of the results. 

This is where it gets complicated. I am 6 years recovered from a very aggressive eating disorder that nearly cost me my life. The recovery was very long, and grueling, but I have found so much relief and mental stability in my treatment plan — i.e. not restricting any types of foods, eating three meals a day, incorporating all food groups, no fasting, no restricting etc. 

Now contrast that with the standard PCOS treatment, particularly for diet changes regarding the insulin resistance part. Seems like a guaranteed setup for failure for someone with body image and eating issues. The potential symptoms of PCOS can ravage any woman’s self esteem, with or without the presence of an ED. With these beauty standards of an effortlessly thin body, a full, luxurious head of hair, and this super obnoxious and outdated, yet somehow still prevalent idea of femininity, it seems like such a cruel joke.

As result, I am experiencing quite a bit of fear and uncertainty. PCOS could possibly undermine all of my work—my mental health, as well as my sense of safety, predictability and control. I don’t know what to do and it feels like I can’t win. 
 
Is anyone else going through something like this right now? How have you managed? What have you been feeling? 

Tl;Dr: PCOS treatment seems to be fundamentally incompatible with the mental health of someone with a history of of eating disorders and body image issues.

UPDATE 3/13: Had ultrasound and fasting glucose test done. The ultrasound, irregular periods, and elevated androgen levels confirmed the PCOS diagnosis. My fasting glucose level was 80. The doctor suggested birth control, which I vehemently declined due to my dibilitating fear of weight gain and increased emotional instability, so we're starting with Metformin extended release. I've been on it for about 6 or 7 weeks now, starting at 500 mg and trying to work up to 1500 mg. I got my period about two weeks after starting it, which was a relief since I had gone 60+ days without it. It's too early to tell if it's making me regular, so we'll have to wait and see.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/18vh6fr/eating_disorder_and_pcos_relapse_appears/,132,1704056922.0,/r/PCOS/comments/18vh6fr/eating_disorder_and_pcos_relapse_appears/
"After 10 years on Metformin, I'm told I don't actually have PCOS","As the title says. 2012 was an extremely stressful year for me with US immigration. By Dec 2012, I had gained weight and I missed 1 period. I was told that my insulin was high, i had some hirsutism and that I had PCOS. No imaging studies or ultrasound, just a male endocrinologist and one lab draw. 
I was immediately put on the highest dose of 2000mg metformin which I had to take 4 times a day at 500mg because the 1000mg pill was too harsh on my stomach.

The past few years have been increasingly hard for me to manage my condition despite researching so much about the condition. The PCOS diet wasn't working, master cleanse for 30 days would give me 2-3 months relief from GI and weight issues, the supplements barely helped (trust me, I have tried *every* herb and supplement listed in research to help with PCOS) . I tried spirolactone with no success. My hirsutism was always limited to 2-4 bumps along the sides of my jawline and left side of my chin. A few supplements for inflammation helped any acne (Glutathione). I was increasingly sensitive to every type of food and tried histamine intolerance diet. I saw an allergist/immunologist (*very* allergic to pine bark/pycnogenol), GI specialist, female endocrinologist, reproductive specialist. I even had a colonoscopy/endoscopy and work-up for celiac disease (negative but some wheat intolerance).

My sister paid for food sensitivities testing, and I adjusted my diet (turns out my #1/2 sensitivities were carrots and horseradish...odd, but good info). I was still having post prandial extreme bloating and started to feel sick in the mornings and I couldn't get out of bed. I tried antidepressants, but I kept feeling like it was an organic/physical depression. I gained 60lbs in 6 months. I couldn't sleep, my long time insomnia got worse and worse. I started to experience eyelid swelling, centripetal obesity, moon face. I suspected adrenal insufficiency and started to take melatonin and vitamin d as a remedy for histamine intolerance - with this I could sleep 2-3 hrs max. I felt like I was swelling up like Violet in Willy Wonka. I tried to see my endocrinologist but after a few years of no success and insurance rejecting Ozempic it seemed like she wanted nothing to do with me.

I woke up end of April one morning and my first thought was ""I feel like I'm going to die today if I don't get some help"". I slowly got myself together, called my mom to come with me and finally went to urgent care with her because of my eyelid swelling. I didn't know what else to do. A doctor there who usually works emergency looked at me and suggested a differential diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. He said he felt helpless because he couldn't do the workup he wanted at urgent care - but he listened to me. I cried.
My testosterone had always tested normal and my AMH was slightly better than ideal for my age (I started my fertility consultation in the fall). 
Cushing's made perfect sense.

I got an ambulatory referral from him to endocrinology and a new list of specialists. I saw one 2 days later. I changed my diet and supplement routine to Cushing's/cortisol diet and finally no bloating, constipation and my energy returned. I finally lost weight naturally without resorting to extreme methods. I started drinking carbonated water after watching a Dr. Berg video on it and it had potassium chloride and I had extreme diuresis for 2-3 days and puffiness went away. I looked in the mirror and for the first time I didn't have any eye bags. Cortisol creates metabolic alkalosis and edema (where sodium goes, water follows) so sodium-free carbonated water has helped so much in balancing out the edema. Cortisol itself raises histamine (which vitamin D and melatonin block), but Cortisol Releasing Hormone is an anti-histamine so it becomes a feedback loop as the body raises CRH to lower histamine.  Increasing my calcium (fresh cheese only -ricotta) and potassium intake has helped as well. Pomegranate, Garlic, Horsetail, and Stinging Nettle too. I have a list, and I have started to slowly reintegrate some foods. I no longer struggle to process gluten or have histamine responses to food. My sleep is slowly improving. Now that I know the signs of the cortisol spikes (eyelid edema is an lesser known sign, insomnia etc) I can manage it better. My hirsutism has gone away - still some scars from the repeated inflammation but they are totally flat - not one inflamed follicle. I can tell that my left adrenal was worse because that's the side where I had the most hirsutism and eyelid swelling. My hair has grown back (I was having androgenic alopecia and had 2-3 bald spots mostly on the left side as well).

Since then, I've had a pelvic abdominal CT, more extensive lab work finally done, and transvaginal ultrasound. I was cleared of PCOS this morning by my new primary care doctor who is amazing and old-school. He told me that I will taper off metformin for the next month or two (I had already kind of started to not take it) and that 10 years of hypoglycemic episodes from the medication likely caused my adrenals to finally quit and protest which is why cortisol took over and it looks like Cushing's - my body was and is sensitive to stress. I'm still getting some additional testing to rule out sleep issues. 

I feel like I finally have my life back. Misdiagnosis sucks and I'm still obviously processing everything. I desperately want to lose this weight I've gained but I'm trying to be compassionate towards myself - healing is not linear and recovery will take time.

I know there's a bigger reason to why my path was so hard. I will still hang around and try to offer tips where I can as the androgenic aspect of stresses out adrenal glands was the same as having PCOS. Cushing's/cortisol-dominance and PCOS/estrogen-dominance are hard to differentiate and I am still working through the nuances but I've found some things that work.

Hopefully this story/vent will help you think carefully about your symptoms and empower you to keep pushing forward until you experience the relief and medical responsiveness we all deserve.

TLDR - misdiagnosed with PCOS. If you take anything from this, please let it be the following:

1. Get a second medical opinion.
2. Listen to your body, if nothing is working it may be a sign too. It doesn't always mean you're failing to manage your health. Don't internalize it that way.
3. Doctors are not gods. They don't like to feel helpless but admitting that they don't know the answers may be the first step towards getting healthy - only stick with one that looks you in the eyes and listens. 
4. Don't quit. It took me finding a thousand ways that didn't work before landing on misdiagnosis - but the knowledge I've gained from research I hope to help others with someday (I am in my PhD but decided I definitely want to finish my MD that I started as well/transfer to that program).",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/13xcrxn/after_10_years_on_metformin_im_told_i_dont/,133,1685611086.0,/r/PCOS/comments/13xcrxn/after_10_years_on_metformin_im_told_i_dont/
Diet Intervention/Change ≠ Diet Culture,"This messaging that somehow choosing to restrict certain foods from your diet is participating in diet culture or disordered eating seems to be growing more popular within PCOS treatment/nutrition spaces. Raise your hand if you feel personally victimized by this sentiment🙋🏾‍♀️🙋🏾‍♀️🙋🏾‍♀️🙋🏾‍♀️

I know quite a few of you do, as I briefly mentioned this issue at the end of a post I wrote yesterday and you all commented feeling the same. 
Since so many people resonated with that part of the post I decided to make a seperate post to discuss this ideology and why it can be very toxic to spread.

I wish certain influencers/dietitians/“nutritionists” (especially those active on social media) would stop labeling restricting certain foods from your diet as diet culture or disordered eating. I’m so sick of hearing this idea that if people don’t eat any and everything they have a taste for they’re somehow disordered, participating in diet culture or both.

Insisting that the only way for someone to not be disordered and not be an active  in diet culture is by learning how to “intuitively eat” any and everything they like the taste of, regardless of how it affects their symptoms is harmful period. 

I like the taste of oreos. I’m also aware that regular/over consumption of oreos causes me EXTREME dysmenorrheic pain. I’m also aware that I am unable to control my oreo intake, resulting in incessant/over consumption. There’s no such thing as “just a few” of those bad boys for me, or “once in a while”. There’s no “intuitively eating” such a high palatable processed food without harm for me. So yes, I choose to **restrict** (*dun dun dun*) them from my diet to avoid the dysmenorrheic pain. If anything, choosing to eat oreos knowing that I can barely control my intake with them, and knowing what happens to me when I eat them is what disordered eating looks like **for me**.

I do not have ‘orthorexia’, I have PCOS and after 7 years of diagnosis I know certain foods make my symptoms exponentially worse, and therefore I CHOOSE to avoid them.

People are not “disordered” for restricting certain foods (or whole entire food groups, yes, food groups!) they know don’t agree with them. You wouldn’t call someone who’s lactose intolerant “disordered” for avoiding dairy, you wouldn’t call someone diagnosed with T2D “disordered” for avoiding sugary foods, so why call people with PCOS who know they can’t handle carbs, sugar, fruits, fried foods, processed foods, dairy, soy or whatever else they have taken note of that makes their symptoms worse “disordered” for choosing not to eat them? Whether we like those foods or not is immaterial. Knowing those foods cause us harm thru personal experience is a good enough reason to avoid them.

Labeling every little change to diet as fad/disordered/diet culture will soon result in those words becoming meaningless.

It’s mindboggling to me that people who claim to specialize in nutrition for PCOS would label any and every type of restriction as disorder/diet culture.
I can understand why this would be the sentiment in generalized nutrition/ED recovery/intuitive eating spaces, because in those spaces it’s not assumed that the majority have metabolic disorders (and that certain foods are avoided not because of negative reactions to those foods but because of stigma or fear).

But for those of us who have been living with metabolic disorders, and have taken note of what food(s) cause us harm, of what benefit is it to tell us that we’re disordered for avoiding them? Or for not learning how to “intuitively eat” them?  (I put IE in quotes because I honestly believe the method of eating being passed off as “IE” by certain people in certain spaces is actually a misappropriation of IE).


None, in my opinion. So please stop.


**Edit: Just a quick disclaimer, I do not believe people who choose not to restrict certain food(s) from their diet are “wrong” in their approach to PCOS treatment regardless of whether those foods negatively affect their symptoms or not. I just believe that those of us who do choose to restrict certain foods from our diet when we know they negatively affect us from personal experiences shouldn’t be labeled as disordered or participating in diet culture. That’s my main spiel**",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/11onax8/diet_interventionchange_diet_culture/,118,1678549520.0,/r/PCOS/comments/11onax8/diet_interventionchange_diet_culture/
Fixing my sleep helped me manage PCOS symptoms and bring my blood sugar back to normal,"I have PCOS and, like a lot of people here, I struggled with low energy, mood swings, irregular cycles, and that constant “wired but tired” feeling — especially in the afternoons.

My doctor told me to exercise more and eat better (which I was already doing), but nothing really changed. Then, I started looking into sleep and recovery — something I had been ignoring.

I got a wearable and started tracking everything. Turns out I was averaging just \~5 hours of sleep per night, fragmented and inconsistent. I hadn’t realized how much that was messing with my hormones, insulin resistance, and mental clarity.

Here’s what I changed that made a huge difference:

* Started taking my multivitamins **in the afternoon**, especially magnesium — it was disrupting my REM sleep at night
* Cut caffeine after 3pm
* Ate blood-sugar-friendly dinners (more protein/fiber, fewer carbs)
* Shut off overhead lights 2 hours before bed
* Stuck to a regular sleep/wake schedule, even on weekends (game changer for my cycle regularity)

After a few weeks, I noticed improvements in my energy, mood, and sleep quality. A couple months later, my blood sugar stabilized, and for the first time in ages, I felt like I had a predictable routine.

I’m now building a tool with my partner that helps people with conditions like PCOS use their own data to create better daily habits — across sleep, stress, movement, and food. It’s designed to be more personalized than the generic stuff most apps give.

If this sounds like something you’d want to try, we’re opening early access soon. Would love feedback from others managing PCOS too 💜

I have a history with anorexia and when I was 19 I went into therapy and have been in recovery for it ever since. I’m in my 30s now and my body has (obviously) changed since a teen and for most of my 20s as I gained weight I was able to combat any old eating disorder thoughts with tools I learned in therapy and was able to love and accept the body I was in. 

Since last spring when I got my PCOS diagnosis I have been obsessing over my belly because every doctor I talk to or anything I see online talks about this “PCOS belly”. So now instead of just being like “yup I have a belly cause this is where my body is happy!” Like I used to, now all I can think and feel is “I feel genetically mutated and something is wrong with my body and my belly is a symptom and something to be ashamed of” and I hate it.

For anyone else who might have battled with this, how did you overcome it? I want to love myself the way I am again and not feel so ashamed of it. 💔

**update** wow I was so nervous about the answers I might get and all of you lovely people have proven me wrong and have extended so much compassion for a stranger on the internet. I thank you all a lot I needed these responses 😪💕",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1dxn94q/how_to_love_your_pcos_belly/,95,1720376868.0,/r/PCOS/comments/1dxn94q/how_to_love_your_pcos_belly/
Reminder that you can live in a body with PCOS and be fat positive.,"I’ve been seeing a weight inclusive PCP who’s been such a healing presence in my life but I recently needed to visit a new OBGYN to get some imaging done and WOOF that was a trip. 

She didn’t look at my chart. She didn’t look at my recent labs or the 2 years of period data I brought in. She didn’t ask for my history. She didn’t know that I have PCOS, am a mother, had c-sections or had a tubal ligation. The first sentence she uttered was about my weight and after agreeing to schedule a TVS she sent me on my way with a page and a half of “BMI Education” stapled to my visit summary. 

It’s been a very long time since I’ve experienced such blatant anti-fat bias from a medical professional and thank goodness I’m in a place in my recovery where I can laugh off her ignorance. Y’all please don’t ever settle for “care” like this. There are so many ways to treat/relieve PCOS symptoms that don’t involve manipulating your body weight. If your doctor isn’t aware of that then they’re not the one for you I promise.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/11tdsfp/reminder_that_you_can_live_in_a_body_with_pcos/,88,1679018128.0,/r/PCOS/comments/11tdsfp/reminder_that_you_can_live_in_a_body_with_pcos/
I feel like I can never recover from eating disorders or disordered eating mindsets with PCOS,"So basically I had been average-slim weight my whole life- I’m currently 110 lbs and fight like hell to retain that weight and size. I was eating disordered and diagnosed with anorexia binging purging subtype when I was around 107 lbs. At that point I had been ED    for 4-5 years at least. However at that point I think I was willing to make an effort because I wanted it to end. I was taking Prozac for depression and obsessive thoughts related to calories and eating. I was starting to come around to the fact that eating was OK and I could have a balanced diet and satisfy my cravings and eat at maintain.

When I got PCOS diagnosis this begin to throw a huge wedge in my recovery. I was told I was not insulin resistance but after that the obsessive thoughts came back tenfold. I was mostly keeping it low carb and doing IF but the thoughts are so so bad. I feel like my mind can never rest from food thoughts and diet thoughts. I feel like if I let myself enjoy a meal (I’m currently abroad and experiencing a new cuisine and culture) I will blow up and my grow a beard and go bald with seconds.  I feel like every single decision like trying a cracker even a piece of fruit is regrettable. 

Before, when I was eating disordered at least I could think “this is in your head, you can eat outside your safe foods” but now I know PCOS and IR is real and concrete and there is nowhere to run and nowhere to hide. 

That’s basically all sorry for the self pitying post. I feel so bad to complain about my life and physical problems when others also suffer.

Best wishes to all PCOS sufferers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/emjam7/i_feel_like_i_can_never_recover_from_eating/,73,1578618265.0,/r/PCOS/comments/emjam7/i_feel_like_i_can_never_recover_from_eating/
"How do you all manage when doctors bring up your weight, even when you are seeing them for non-weight related/ non-PCOS concerns?","So, I went to the doctor this morning to receive a physical therapy referral for TMJ/jaw pain. It's been pretty bad lately and my orthodontist says my night guard should be helping (well, it isn't!). After googling a bit, I saw that exercises and manual therapy from a physical therapist can help. Feeling hopeful, I scheduled an appointment with a new doctor at my regular primary care office who was available sooner than my usual dr. 

First of all, the medical assistant weighed me twice and announced my weight in front of all the receptionists/office staff right next to where the scale was. Not off to the best start!! I used to ask not have it read to me, because in my early eating disorder recovery it was extremely triggering, but I haven't felt a strong need to do that in awhile. 

Then, the first thing my doctor asked me, is why I think I've gained so much weight since my last visit, and grilled me about what my nutrition and exercise habits are. Like, girl, that's not why I'm here! And it is really hurtful, because I exercise between 3-5 times a week and see a registered dietitian nutritionist to help me stay on track with my ED recovery/continue eating a balanced diet to support my PCOS symptoms. I wasn't there for reasons AT ALL related to my weight - I simply wanted a referral for TMJ physical therapy. I'm feeling so down and hopeless right now, like my body is broken, and doctors are never going to treat me with respect and kindness again. How do you all manage issues like this?

**TLDR:** my doctor brought up my weight excessively when I was seeing her for jaw pain (a totally unrelated concern) - how do y'all manage?!",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1500r0o/how_do_you_all_manage_when_doctors_bring_up_your/,66,1689391719.0,/r/PCOS/comments/1500r0o/how_do_you_all_manage_when_doctors_bring_up_your/
Working on my eating disorder recovery has helped my PCOS - without restriction or low carb,"Hey everyone,

I started showing PCOS symptoms when I gained more and more weight due to my eating disorder and since the PCOS onset late 2017, I've had only two or three natural periods. I was also diagnosed with insulin resistance. The diagnoses really worsened my ED and depression. I was constantly trying to restrict, only to end up ordering pizza and eating ice cream and other high carb foods that I labelled as bad and forbidden. The prospect of being forced to restrict a food group to help my PCOS symptoms felt like having to pick between physical health and mental health.

This summer, I went back to ED treatment and began following the meal plan. All meals contain all food groups. I thought it would never work and even make my PCOS worse... 

...so imagine my surprise when I started my first natural period in over 8 months after 5 weeks of eating balanced meals. The only thing that changed significantly is my diet.

I made this post to encourage everyone struggling with an eating disorder of any kind who feels the way I did about following a ""PCOS diet"" to seek help and establish some semblance of a balanced diet before resorting to restricting carbs. It may not work for everyone, but it's worth a try and a good starting point..",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/d0f33t/working_on_my_eating_disorder_recovery_has_helped/,68,1567767461.0,/r/PCOS/comments/d0f33t/working_on_my_eating_disorder_recovery_has_helped/
General advice/info from PCOS symposium,"I recently watched most of the presentations from day 1 and day 2 of the recent PCOS Challenge symposium and thought I would provide a general summary of the advice given. Hopefully this is OK to do! Btw you can still buy tickets and watch recordings of each presentation for yourself, there are also several Q&A sessions and panels that I didn't watch all of, so I highly recommend [checking it out](https://www.accelevents.com/e/pcossymposium2020day2) if you can. I think the recordings are available for 30 days from the day of the symposium - so day 2 recordings of the symposium are available until ~19th October. Day 1 of the symposium covered fertility stuff that may also interest you but IMO a lot of the takeaways was similar to the lifestyle stuff on day 2. I didn't watch any of day 3 which I think was largely around adolescent health. (fyi - you need to buy a separate $40 ticket for each day that you are interested in. For most people, that would probably be day 2). There was also a lot of explanation about the various aspects of PCOS, how cycles and the endocrine/reproductive systems work and what is happening when PCOS is involved etc, I won't go into any of that here but will answer any questions as best as I can.

Note that the advice and information given was very general, and may not apply to your specific situation. I took notes but also relying on memory for some of this so it may not all be 100% accurate. 



**Diagnosis**

The Rotterdam criteria is generally the most accepted criteria for diagnosing PCOS.


**Weight**

The fat shaming or ""just lose weight"" approach that many doctors take is not helpful and you should avoid these doctors. While losing weight can help with PCOS, it is better to make it about optimizing for health rather than focusing on the number on the scale. (I was less focused on the weight aspect so I hope I've managed to convey the general attitude about weight reasonably well - apologies if I haven't). 


**Diet**

Most speakers did not advocate for any one particular diet. Instead, think about what you can add to your diet, rather than restrict, and keep it sustainable for the long term! General guidelines for what/how you should eat:

* aim for half of your meal to be fruits and veges, a quarter protein and a quarter *low GI* carbs, and a small amount of healthy fats. Get plenty of fiber - 25g per day!
* there is no particular reason to avoid dairy, gluten or soy, unless you do feel better without them (caveat: one doctor on day 1 did say that their studies showed that dairy can worsen things but did not elaborate further)
* aim for unprocessed foods as much as possible - plant based whole foods is best! (note this doesn't specifically exclude meat/animal products)
* increase anti-inflammatory foods - green tea, nuts/seeds, veges/fruits, omega 3, flaxseed, fermented foods containing live active cultures (pre/probiotics), e.g. kombucha, kimchi, pickles, yoghurt, fermented soy
* decrease inflammatory foods - sugary drinks/foods, refined carbs, processed meat, fried/charred foods, excess omega 6
* timing of your meals - try to eat around the same time each day; eat fewer, larger meals; limit snacking; have dinner and next day breakfast 13+ hours apart (intermittent fasting)
* eat more of your calories earlier in the day. Studies show that eating half of your daily calories at breakfast led to lower androgen/insulin levels
* **edit to add:** another recommendation was if you have a glucose monitor, using that to see what spikes your blood sugar so you know what foods to personally avoid - since something that spikes one person might not spike another. Also can use it to see the effects of foods you eat in combination e.g. carbs with a protein, carbs with a fat etc.

**Exercise**

The bottom line: any exercise you can do is good! It lowers androgens and increases insulin sensitivity. There is no ""bad"" exercise for PCOS however doing _too much_ may be detrimental. 

* Aim for a minimum of 120 minutes of vigorous exercise per week
* Try not to do more than 60 minutes in any one day (this is where it may get detrimental), but if you're an athlete doing more than this then you may need help to optimize your recovery
* If you had to pick only one type of exercise, strength training is meant to be the best as it increases your lean muscle mass and this is great for PCOS because it makes your body so much better at using energy and regulating everything. Do upper body push, upper body pull, core, and leg exercises, increasing progressively.
* But _anything_ that you can do and keep up is great
* Try to do something light on your rest days like a walk or a short, light yoga session
* Yoga is also good for PCOS and there are a few studies that show this
* HIIT was also discussed and said to be great exercise too. Recommendation was max 20 mins at a time, with alternating short periods of high intensity and low intensity exercise, e.g. 30 seconds high intensity then 30 seconds low intensity.


**Meds**

There was some discussion of metformin (including vs inositol), but spiro and BC were generally only mentioned in passing. Metformin may be helpful but not necessarily for everyone, and inositol may be as good as metformin but without the side effects (personal note: I don't think inositol is _entirely_ without side effects). BC has its place but too many doctors throw BC at patients and say ""come back when you want to get pregnant"".


**Supplements**

Supplements were discussed in various presentations. I will just give a list of some of the supplements discussed - inositol, berberine, NAC, melatonin, vitamin D, omega 3, zinc, CoQ10, probiotics, white peony, licorice, EGCG(?), saw palmetto, spearmint, pygeum bark. Obviously it's not recommended to take all of these, just some supplements that might be recommended/beneficial depending on your specific situation.

* For inositol, 40:1 myo/d-chiro inositol is best
* Make sure you take any supplements correctly (with a meal, at specific time etc)
* Check for fillers in supplements
* make sure that they have been certified by one of two organisations (for those US based) - since supplements are unregulated


**Other lifestyle factors**

* stay hydrated!
* manage stress and emotional/mental health. Therapy, meditation etc. From memory, the insights timer app was recommended for meditation but anything you find and use to get started is good. The PCOS psychologist talked about various issues you might face, including depression, anxiety, anger/irritability, eating problems, relationship/sexual problems etc.
* ensure adequate sleep. Try to have a consistent routine with sleeping and eating to try and get your body to fall into a natural circadian rhythm. If you keep waking up feeling unrefreshed after 8 hours sleep, consider looking into sleep apnea.


**Blood tests**

There was a talk on blood tests for PCOS. In summary, reference ranges are set by labs using the distribution of samples from within the population. This means that your results can be ""normal"" (falls within the range found in 95% of the ""normal"" population) but can still be too low/high. Examples given - the range for testosterone may be approximately 14-76 (depending on the lab), but anything over 45 would be indicative of PCOS. Similarly with DHEA-S - the range would be approximately 44-425 but in PCOS you would often see values over 200. 


Be a detective in figuring out what works for you, make a plan, and make one or two small changes at a time, to help build better habits that stick for the long term - it's a marathon, not a sprint!",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/j6sk7d/general_adviceinfo_from_pcos_symposium/,64,1602083346.0,/r/PCOS/comments/j6sk7d/general_adviceinfo_from_pcos_symposium/
I GOT MY PERIOD TODAY,"After not getting my period for TWO YEARS, I finally got my period today and I’m crying tears of joy 😭. I’ve spent sooo much time trying to correct my hormones/deal with PCOS symptoms and I feel like I’ve finally done something right. I’ve seen so many doctors and tried so many different supplements/diets and I think there are a few things that finally got my body on the right track! First, I added two supplements into my routine with the specific purpose of addressing the insulin resistance that seems to be at the core of PCOS: 
* Amla Tea: taken in the morning before any food
* Berberine HCL: a capsule taken at each meal
These were the most recent addition to my routine, so I suspect they have been pretty important!

Other things that I think played a role:
*Ovasitol: I started taking it two months ago so I’m not 100% sure that it has helped but I’ve read that it can take months to start working and it’s one of the few things I’ve been really consistent with so I think it likely played a big role. 
*Essential oils: I’ve been using two blends by YL, endoflex (applied daily to the skin over the thyroid) and progessence (applied daily to the inside of the forearm). I know that essential oils are hotly debated and I honestly didn’t have any faith in them—my mom gave them to me and I figured I didn’t have anything to lose. I liked the scent so I have been using them religiously for about two months.

Diet: I have tried everythingggg and I really don’t think that anything made a difference. I’ve tried HCLF, keto, high protein, you name it and I’ve tried it (note, I did all this as a vegan who is allergic to gluten). **However!! I read a study about soy having a positive effect on hormonal balance so for the past month I have been eating soy every day, sometimes multiple times a day. So I think this definitely could have been a contributing factor!

Weight: during these two years my weight has steadily risen about twenty pounds even though I was eating the same amount of calories. It didn’t bother me too much at first but over the past month I decided to eat in a modest deficient to see if I could lose a few. In the time I have lost about five pounds, but I don’t think it played any role in regaining my period.

Exercise: I’ve always been pretty active but I think that changing my activity style has been really important. I used to do a lot of HIIT and I completely cut that, switching to walking between 10k-20k steps per day. I think that this was important for me because my PCOS was likely caused by an extended period of high stress (college and relationship drama all at once, and for a couple of years). So I think that giving my body a bit of a break was really important. 

PCOS is a beast; it’s absolutely exhausting and so expensive to manage as I know all of my sisters here are familiar with. It’s consumed so much of my life for so long so I really really hope that this period is the start of a long-term recovery (for lack of a better word haha). I wanted to share a bit of my journey in hopes that maybe some of it will be helpful for someone else!! Love you all; the support that we share here has been (and I’m sure will continue to be) so essential for my mental wellbeing and I’m thankful for each of you 💕 we CAN do it girls!! 💪",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/hufbl8/i_got_my_period_today/,56,1595221334.0,/r/PCOS/comments/hufbl8/i_got_my_period_today/
Help me understand what my girlfriend is going through?,"Hello!
 
I've been dating this amazing chick for three months, now. She told me early on that she has PCOS. She explained it to me, and I mostly understand. She has other worries, some being that kidney disease and cystic kidneys run on both sides of her family (her father passed away from a stroke during recovery from a kidney transplant) and apparently PCOS can increase your odds of kidney related illnesses.
 
I've Googled PCOS in an effort to learn more, but it's all textbook stuff, and I want to learn about it from people actually living with this.
 
I'm curious about how it effects cramps and PMS? She says it doesn't change either, but she seems to be in more pain than any other woman I've known when going through their period. I know every woman doesn't feel symptoms the same, but I want to make sure I can help/ know what to do.
 
She says that keto diets can help with some of the symptoms. Can anyone help me understand this? I've never tried keto, but if it can make her life a little easier, I'd give it a shot. I know what it feels like to try dieting alone, and I'm positive her eating habits have declined since meeting me (I'm the bad influence, here).
 
She says it effects her hormones. She has thinner hair, and some facial hair. It doesn't bother me at all. How else does this effect one's hormones and body? 
 
Does PCOS cause pain in general? Can it cause head aches? She says it makes her back hurt. Is there a massage I can do to help relieve some of that?
 
I've casually asked her some of these questions, or she's brought it up on her own. I don't want her to feel like I'm grilling her or having second thoughts about us, so I thought I'd ask y'all.

Being told to quit Lifting - help.,"Newly diagnosed, even though I’ve known I’ve had PCOS + IR for years, I’ve just never been taken seriously because I was thinner + younger. 

To make an incredibly long story short, I’ve been told by several dietician/doctors to stop weight lifting / high intensity exercise while my body battles the most severe PCOS flare I’ve ever experienced. My blood work has shown elevated cortisol for 8+ months, my bloating + IBS + inflammation is crippling, and my severe fatigue bouts are constant. I have tracked macros (I have experience doing this accurately for years w dietician, fitness coaches, etc) and am eating much less than I should and still not losing weight (1500-1700c avg over the course of the year, 150lb 5’4 female, very muscular, 10-12k steps a day, 4x heavy weight sessions a week) my elevated cortisol, malnutrition bio markers on blood work, puffy face/ constant water retention, fatigue, and weight gain are ruining my life. 

I lift heavy (talking hypertrophy training / powerlifting 4x a week). Falling in love with lifting has saved me from a lifetime of pursuing thinness/ shrinking myself, is my primary form of stress relief, and social outlet from my friends in the gym. In many ways it has saved my life and been the foundation of my recovery from various EDs. 

I’m being told that in order to get a hold of my hormones, cortisol, and lose weight, I should opt for lower impact movement + keep my heart rate low. I have a TERRIBLE relationship with Pilates and yoga due to abusing it during a past eating disorder,and feel at a complete loss. I have built so much h strength and muscle, and feel like I’m being told to give up this lifestyle I’ve fallen completely in love with. 

Other lifestyle changes I’m implementing in hopes of keeping weightlifting while reversing my symptoms: 500mg metformin for IR, drastically reducing caffine consumption, slower walks in am, digestive enzymes + ashwaganda for ibs/cortisol, therapy for stress management. 

To those that have reversed their PCOS/ IR / high cortisol symptoms while still doing “high intensity” workouts (also I don’t really understand what this means .. my lifts are high intensity due to the weight but this is needed for true hypertrophy + muscle growth, but I’m not doing HIIT or exhaustive cardio circuits.) … how did you get out of a flare up while still exercising how you enjoy? 

Any advice is helpful!",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1alamyj/being_told_to_quit_lifting_help/,39,1707332423.0,/r/PCOS/comments/1alamyj/being_told_to_quit_lifting_help/
dieting is triggering?,"CONTENT WARNING///  
body talk; eating disorders; dieting  
///////////////////////  
Hey all!!  
I have a question about eating disorder recovery and body image issues, if anyone could share some advice/perspective for me!  
So I struggled with anorexia nervosa for a couple years as a 14/15 year old, but no longer do, and actually gained a significant amount of weight during my senior year of high school (2020!) amidst the pandemic, leaving an abusive environment, healing my inner child, and feeling food freedom for the first time in a while.   
My doctor is an angel and knows my past with this, and makes sure to never trigger me, but the fact of the matter is that according to ""science"", I am overweight and need to lose a lot.   
I also have PCOS, and so managing my sugar intake/carb intake is important for my insulin resistance issues, and is being monitored closely by my doctor.   
Sooo, that's all to say, that I am trying to eat more whole foods, less refined sugars, more fruits/veggies, less carbs, less fast food to try to lose the weight and also keep my blood sugar levels in check.  
My issue, though, is that it is kinda triggering and demoralizing to be watching my sugar intake; reading nutrition labels for cereals/coffee creamers in the store to see the sugar/carb content; forcing myself to eat spinach or other greens when I just would rather have Taco Bell as a soure of comfort food (I am also going through a horrible breakup currently).  
Sorry I am rambling. Basically, I am wondering if any of you in eating disorder recovery or who struggled/struggle with body image and body dysmorphia handle ""dieting"", or managing your weight or other health issues that your doctor wants you to keep track of.  
How do you not feel constantly triggered? How do you enjoy eating the stuff that your body needs most, without feeling like you're punishing yourself/reverting back to your ED tendencies??

Gained 21 pounds in 3 1/2 weeks,"Saw my OBGYN on 12/19 for surgery to remove an endometrioma. During surgery, she found stage 3 endometriosis and burned it out. Due to pain from the cyst and then recovery, I haven’t worked out in about 5 months. Saw my endocrinologist today and I’m up 21 pounds in less than a month. She’s running tons of tests but I was sobbing. I’m so uncomfortable in my own skin. I’ve always been able to manage my weight until I did a few years of IVF to no avail. 
She didn’t prescribe anything and is waiting for the labs to come back. My fear is they’ll show nothing and I keep gaining. Has anyone had anything similar? I’m 10 years in recovery from bulimia so body image is a struggle for me. My clothes don’t fit and I just feel gross.

Today I was reminded how dismissive doctors can be,"I joined this subreddit about a year ago as I was at my lowest-low and was continually met with doctors who dismissed me and that something was wrong between unexplained weight gain, excessive fatigue and brain fog, and brutal periods post a 16 year run on birth control. I looked to this group for advice, which helped tremendously, but I still wanted more. It was July 2022 when I was officially diagnosed, but not by a traditional doctor, but a nutritionist who read my bloodwork a previous endo had offered, and of course dismissed, and identified the insulin resistance and high cortisol levels that others had told me were “textbook within range.” Since then, and by following her recommendations of changes to diet and exercise, I was able to lose 25 pounds and regain quality of life almost immediately. The insulin component had frightened me, so I did decide to try Mounjaro (which a telehealth provider had prescribed off of same bloodwork) and over the course of 11 months I have lost 75 pounds between lifestyle changes (which I am quite strict with) and medication. 

I decided to try a traditional endo again today for the sake of getting updated bloodwork. The entire appointment, I was reminded, but not shocked, at how dismissive traditional doctors can be. She told me I didn’t look like I had PCOS (I do not have acne or excess facial hair), and that I was just obese.  By standards, I am; I am 5’8 and currently 192 pounds however I have a naturally bigger frame and my workouts are generally low impact with heavy lifting so I do hold a lot of muscle mass. She also stated because my periods are currently normal (which I explained they only recently became as such), I must not have PCOS. She also said because I don’t actually have cysts, it can’t be and that insulin resistance isn’t “real.”

She then proceeded to read the previous bloodwork from a year ago, and told me that everything was “medical standards within range” and reiterated that I was just overweight. She didn’t feel the need to explore bloodwork further. She also claimed that it seemed maybe the whole reason I went on Mounjaro to begin with is just because I was actually just overweight.  

I responded to her with that this was not the first time I had been dismissed by doctors, and weight loss aside, my journey over the past year has proven a better quality of life. I am no longer constantly fatigued, I don’t feel like I am in fight or flight mode everyday, I have a normal period, and I have lowered my blood pressure as well as my resting heart rate. I also asked, why wouldn’t I want to see updated bloodwork? Isn’t the end goal to see improvements, regardless of where I fall within the ranges? She was not happy. I should also call out that when I noted how I think Ovasitol has been crucial in helping me, she rolled her eyes and laughed.  

Thankfully, I am currently in a much better headspace than I was a year ago and I took it for what it was worth, but I left feeling disappointed not really for myself but for all the others who are dealing with dismissive doctors. I have been there, and it reminded me of how long it actually took for me to get real answers and help. 

It’s disappointing because we are supposed to be able to rely on medical professionals for help, but more times than not we are continually dismissed. I know the runaround that I had for years trying to figure out what was wrong with me, and how defeated I felt. It almost seems as though doctors sometimes want to keep you sick and are not supportive of the road to recovery or better management of PCOS.

This is not to knock all endos and traditional doctors as I am sure some are great, but in my experience, and from what I have heard from many others struggling to seek help, the medical field needs to DO BETTER. 

I am happy and grateful more than ever I continued to look for answers and found help finally with a non-traditional method and as much as I post this as a rant, I also write it with an empathetic tone above anything else for those who are currently struggling with answers. Groups like this are always helpful and supportive to help know you are not alone, but also know there will always be someone out there who listens and helps - in my case, a nutritionist. 

Just please keep your head up and know that you know your body better than anyone. You got this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/14e1god/today_i_was_reminded_how_dismissive_doctors_can_be/,28,1687237271.0,/r/PCOS/comments/14e1god/today_i_was_reminded_how_dismissive_doctors_can_be/
Don’t beat yourself up about things you can’t control,"I try to exercise regularly- some kind of PCOS appropriate yoga, bike riding, or walking 3 times a week. It’s good for my mental health - usually. The past three months I have been just exhausted- everything feels like it’s harder, I’m lacking motivation, recovery was taking longer, etc. I realized on my bike ride today that I have been mentally berating myself about this for months. Calling myself lazy for staying in bed or cutting a workout short. Being disappointed that my bike mph is much slower than last year. Thinking that walks and hikes suck because I gained weight during the pandemic.  Thinking there was something lacking in me because my legs feel heavy when I exercise. 

Then today it hit me: I was diagnosed with anemia about four months ago. (Likely due to ridiculously heavy periods and a uterine polyp I just had removed.) I have been on iron pills, but my ferritin is still pretty low. That means I have fewer red blood cells to ferry oxygen through my body than I did last year. *Of course* I’m going to be more tired. *Of course* recovery is going to take longer. 

So be gentle and kind with yourselves, always. Your body is doing the best it can.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/nqpo83/dont_beat_yourself_up_about_things_you_cant/,26,1622650951.0,/r/PCOS/comments/nqpo83/dont_beat_yourself_up_about_things_you_cant/
"finally at peace with eating disorder, gutted by PCOS diagnosis","you can probably extrapolate based on the title. i've spent most of my life consumed by an undiagnosed eating disorder. i never received treatment because in my family you could never be too skinny (i come from orthorexic, crunchy stock).  i wasted my adolescence consumed by my disordered eating, going through cycles of purging and intense restriction and then gaining the weight back. repeat ad nauseum. i am in my mid-late twenties now and have put so much time and energy toward repairing my relationship with food. i have had to DIY this recovery shit. i feel like i've only just now arrived at a point in my life where i could accept that there were no inherently 'bad' foods and i had began to eat intuitively. 

my weight has stabilized. i am of an average build, not overweight, and my only symptoms were irregular periods and hormonal acne, but my doctor ran blood tests just in case. hormone ratios came back indicative of PCOS, which means i meet diagnostic criteria. i've booked a follow-up appointment and i suspect we'll be checking for insulin resistance next. there is some diabetes and prediabetes in my family so i think i know where this is going.

i've been going down the rabbit hole of what this means for me and i am devastated. i have finally taken myself off a lifelong restrictive diet and i will now likely be asked to adopt another restrictive diet. i am poor and i live in the US so the odds of me seeing a dietician are slim. i feel like i can't handle this. can anyone please offer me some reassurance or at least similar experiences? all i can see right now is a return to a life where i am so fixated on food that i cannot maintain normal relationships with people. i have a lifetime of anecdotal evidence to show that as long as i am micromanaging my diet, i can never know peace. i finally got a taste of 'normal life'. i can cook for my girlfriend, i can eat meals with friends. i know i sound melodramatic right now but i'm so scared to go back",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/zq1wnj/finally_at_peace_with_eating_disorder_gutted_by/,25,1671480114.0,/r/PCOS/comments/zq1wnj/finally_at_peace_with_eating_disorder_gutted_by/
General Health and Weight Loss Tips and Advice!,"I’ve noticed a lot of people ask for weight loss advice so just wanted to share some tips that have worked for me. It’s a learning process and a whole lifestyle change that I’m still trying to adapt. I’ve tried Saxenda before I got diagnosed, and I did lose a lot of weight, but as soon as I stopped it, even with staying on the same habits, I gained most of the weight back. After being diagnosed, I spoke to a dietitian and started really looking into how to lose weight with insulin resistance PCOS. Let me tell you all the advice I’ve gathered.

1- Never skip meals, and make sure to have vegetables at the beginning of every meal, whether it being just some vegetables or a salad. Make sure you use non-starchy vegetables! Have 1-2 fruits a day as a snack between breakfast and lunch, or between lunch and dinner.

2- Supplements: I’ve been taking vitamin d, inositol, berberine, magnesium, iron, and I’m also on glucophage that I take twice a day with lunch and dinner. Check your vitamin levels and stay hydrated.

3- The order in which you eat food matters in order to lower blood sugar spikes. For example with carbs, you should have it with protein or right after protein. Vegetables first!

4- Look into glucosegoddess on instagram, her advice has been helping me, I highly recommend reading her book “Glucose Recovery”

5- Apple cider vinegar, it tastes terrible but try having it before your main meal, just 1 tbsp with a glass of water could lower your blood sugar spike by around 30%

6- Exercise, a 10 min walk after your meal reduces insulin spikes. Try working out around 5 times a week, even a simple home workout is great! If I’m doing cardio, I aim to keep my heart rate no higher than Zone 2.

The reason I mention all this is because with insulin resistance, the more glucose spikes we experience, the more insulin is released from our body. Too much insulin is the root cause of obesity and PCOS, so doing these things helps flatten our glucose curves, which will flatten our insulin curves. I know it sounds like a lot, and I’m no medical professional, just things I’ve learnt from reading and speaking with dieticians.

I hope this is helpful but feel free to try whatever you think will work best for you! Remember you’re not alone, and just always try your best!",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1d486fy/general_health_and_weight_loss_tips_and_advice/,22,1717086559.0,/r/PCOS/comments/1d486fy/general_health_and_weight_loss_tips_and_advice/
PCOS cyst removal-post surgery thoughts! How I convinced my gyno to send me to surgery + my hospital experience.,"Hello lovely ladies! Tonight I shall regale you the story of how I convinced my new gyno to send me to surgery (finally) and how I'm doing post-op (because I'm a little bored and I figured it might help someone). There's Part One and Part Two of this post (which will have TL;DRs for your convenience). 

**Part One TL;DR: I explain my gyno history and how I convinced my current gyno to send me to surgery. I had my medical records from 2016 forward and insisted we not ""medicate"" or ""wait and see"" because we tried that for years and nothing was working.** 

So long story short, since 2016 I''d been having intermittent but severe abdominal pain. I visited with a gyno and he was the first to diagnose me with PCOS. He took a ""wait and see"" approach to my care and prescribed me with depoprovera and sent me on my way. 

The weight gain on that medication was awful. I went back to the doctor and we got into a disagreement that he was doing nothing for my care, that the pain was still there and now I was more overweight than I was before. He refused to do anything else. I left his office with my medical records in hand (very important) and went to go find another gyno who would take me more seriously. 

Second gyno was a bit more understanding and did a few baseline ultrasounds and transvaginal ultrasounds. She and I went over my results and I asked her, ""yo, I need surgery to pull these out; they hurt!"" 

To which she replied, ""you're too young for surgery"". WTF I'm 28, ma'am. She said the cysts would resolve on their own and gave me Estarylla for birth control. On the bright side, my periods became regular and I stopped having super heavy periods (or none at all). I left her office feeling a little disheartened yet hopeful that what she said was true. 

Cue several ER visits later, in which they did ultrasounds and CT scans and found more cysts and *gasp!* a small fibroid! My gyno at the time said, ""don't worry, the fibroid is small and there's only one"". 

Fast forward to present day, wherein my pain was excruciating on the right side and I went to the ER (after vomiting due to the pain). We ruled out ovarian torsion and my appendix, but the pain persisted. They also found *gasp!* multiple fibroids! And the one that I had was now bigger. Though the ER doctor DID have an OBGYN on call, he refused to call someone for me and send me home with Naproxen (that didn't even touch the pain).

So after a few days of suffering, missing work, and multiple phonecalls to every gyno in the valley, I was finally about to get in that week to be seen. I was able to get records from all of my past gyno appointments of my ultrasounds (the ones I didn't already have). 

Here's where things made a difference: I handed the new gyno's staff, the day before my appointment, all of my medical records and ultrasound reports from 2016 forward. Then when I sat down with him, I basically told him that we'd done the ""wait and see"" approach and ""let's medicate approach"" and nothing was resolving. The cyst on the right side had persisted through several years and had not gone away or resolved on its own like it should have. 

So with my urgent pleading that the doctor send me to surgery, he agreed (with all of the evidence that I had presented) and we scheduled it for the next week. He even prescribed me Tramadol for the pain. What a guy! 

**Part Two TL;DR: I just had surgery! Doing fine. The doctor and I discussed beforehand what he was going to do for me. I followed every step that the hospital gave me to prepare. What my hospital experience was like. Some tips for surgery recovery.** 

Surgery anticipation, for me, was the worst part. I'd discussed with my new gyno the risks of the surgery (losing my right ovary, possible scarring of my uterus where the fibroids were if he decided to remove them at the time, etc). I was convinced, by my own paranoia, that I'd lose my right ovary. 

Surgery prep was pretty standard, but there were a few things I had to do. No food or drink after 11pm the night before, wash with antibacterial soap, no lotions or jewelry (I even had to take my wedding rigs off the day of surgery). I wore very loose clothes to surgery (I even left my bra at home). Since I was on my period at the time of surgery, they gave me mesh underwear and a fresh pad to wear. Even though I'm overweight, everything fit fine. No shaving of the area allowed, either (this risks infection later; don't do it). 

Once I was checked in, the staff got my vitals, followed up with questions about my medication history and any reactions to anesthesia. Overall it was actually a pretty pleasant experience. The staff was very kind and the nurse who put my IV in got it on the first try (your mileage may vary; I'm a hard stick so this was awesome). 

The new gyno visited with me before surgery and we discussed, again, what the plan was gonna be. He said he'd look at my fibroids but he doubted that he'd have to pull them out now because they were still small (and he didn't). However the cyst came out without and issue and he was able to preserve my right ovary. Huzzah! 

Before surgery, they took me into the OR and made me slide from my bed onto the operation table. Once I was settled, the anesthesiologist gave me the stuff and I was asleep within a minute. Surgery was about 1-2 hours long. 

Getting out of anesthesia was the hard part. I have asthma so I needed an asthma treatment once I woke up. Beyond that, I was just sleepy and groggy but it got better with time. 

They moved me to my room where I was reunited with my husband. The doctor spoke with my husband to let him know how everything went. 

Once I was in recovery, they made me walk just a little and delivered my pain medications to go home with. Walking wasn't too bad; the pain medications definitely helped. Getting out of the bed required a weird rolling maneuver so that I wasn't doing a direct sit-up. I got it to work. 

Before I'd gone to surgery, my husband and I cleaned the house and changed the sheets on our bed. DO THIS. It really helps with healing morale and makes everything easier. 

Husband got me a chocolate shake on our way home and fries. The fries made me a little nauseous at first but better within a few minutes because I'd had nothing to eat and having something in my stomach was great. The shake REALLY helped (and it was tasty). 

Home recovery has involved lots of sleeping with tons of pillows, walking up and down the hallway, more sleeping, sitting up and watching my husband play videogames, eating some soup and more sleeping. I'm usually not awake at this hour, but my sleep schedule is all whack right now. That's normal. 

Take the stool softener. Bearing down will hurt like hell and possibly cause complications. So take the stool softener. 

You might have a burning sensation with peeing afterwards. That's the anesthesia leaving your body. Some people get it. If it persists, talk to your doctor. 

Burp and fart all you want!!!!!! That's the gas that they put into your body if you got a laparoscopic procedure (like I did). You'll feel less bloated with each time that you do. 

Sore throat? That's normal. It's the breathing tube that they put down your throat that causes that. It'll go away in a few days.

Message people on your social media networks to let them know you're okay once you're able to do so. They will worry, believe me!  

And above all: hydrate and don't be afraid to walk. Walking helps with recovery. Water helps to repair tissues. 

Down time will be anywhere from a 1-2 weeks. I've got work on Monday so that's fun for me.... but I've got an easy desk job and an understanding boss so this should be fine for me. Your mileage will vary. 

As for removing the cyst... I feel great! That might be the painkillers talking right now, but the persistent pain and heaviness is gone. 

So if you have a surgery coming up, or would like to figure out how to convince your gyno to get you to surgery (if needed), feel free to send me a message! Best of luck to all of you!

PCOS insomnia is ruining my life. ,"I used to be a full time college student with a part time job, frequent gym goer & profesional belly dancer. I was a “model citizen” doing everything “right”. The tea is, i could **never** sleep! I would get two hours every *other* night. I was exhausted & by all normal accounts should be falling asleep as soon as i hit the pillow. It drove me to extremely difficult mental states, even tho my life was “perfect”. 

With what i know now, that i have PCOS, it was my hormones (specifically androgens) operating through the roof with my high paced life style. 

Present day, i have been out of college unemployed for a year due to extreme life events. In my recovery, I have slept for the first time in 10 years. Without anywhere to be or anything to do, i am stress free and i sleep soundly. I feel like a human for the first time in my adult life. 

However, obviously that cant last forever. I need to get back into the real world soon. Problem is, as soon as i try, my insomnia comes back ten fold. 

I will be awake for days at a time. But im not awake, im a zombie. I can’t get a job because im so sleep deprived that i can’t move, let alone drive. Once i’m lucky enough to fall asleep, i will stay asleep. The only problem is i usually cant fall asleep until 4am. Sucks when the world wakes up at 6. 

I want to know does anyone else struggle with this symptom? 

Also, does anyone have a low stress job that allows you to easily manage your pcos? I have a comm degree. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1eghuj1/pcos_insomnia_is_ruining_my_life/,21,1722413916.0,/r/PCOS/comments/1eghuj1/pcos_insomnia_is_ruining_my_life/
I keep getting prescribed weight loss and it’s killing me,"So I (24F) was diagnosed w PCOS last month after a year and a half of advocating. Actually the only thing that got me the diagnosis was moving back to the US, and wouldn’t you know they did an ultrasound and I was right. 

Basically my period never ends. I might have q day or two here and there but for the most part, it’s every day. And I passed 3 massive (nearly 1/4 cup) clots in 36 hours and I contacted my old gyno for an urgent appointment. 

For context, I have a meeting w my primary doctor coming up to talk about my ADHD meds and my PCOS diagnosis, but the first of these massive clots made me decide to call the gyno. I felt like I couldn’t leave the house and I gotta start a new job next week lol. 

So anyways I go in with hope, and I express to the nurse as I always do that I’m in recovery from an eating disorder to explain why I don’t look at the scale and I like to give a heads up that I’m sensitive about the topic of weight an stuff. 

So she asks me questions and sets me up, then a doctor I’ve never had before walks in and immediately goes “you’re incredibly overweight. Not to be rude. But you are very very overweight and that is why you’re having this issue” and I was like “yeah I understand that’s a factor but I have experienced this for a long time and I’ve always been overweight, even when I was a little kid. But I’m having this immediate problem I need help with” 

Keep in mind when my primary scheduled me for a ultrasound, she said there were some medications we could talk about to manage my symptoms right now, and I have made lifestyle changes in the last year which she said would also likely help. 

Back to today, this gyno was just insistent. Expressing there’s really nothing to do other than me loosing weight. She was like “well I can try you on progesterone for now but you just really need to loose weight” and I’m so frustrated bc weight loss is not a prescription. If I broke my leg I would probably be prescribed physical therapy, but also be put in a cast. It’s both. And I kept expressing “this is the severity and I have made lifestyle changes and it hasn’t done really anything” and she just wouldn’t hear it. Just kept saying how overweight I am and how the only solution is to loose weight. 

I experienced this back in the UK where I approached a doctor about a seemingly compromised immune system and the same non stop period, and until i got assigned a doctor that listened to me, I had a np/doctor insisting i had come to her for gastric bypass (turns out I was just severely anemic to the point it affected my immune system but I found that out only after seeing a different doctor) 

I just don’t know what to do in these situations. I’m going to go back to my primary and talk to her but Jesus. Like I get being overweight can lead to issues but I feel like doctors just don’t listen to me sometimes. 

Do you all have experiences like this? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1k1pt1u/i_keep_getting_prescribed_weight_loss_and_its/,19,1744929546.0,/r/PCOS/comments/1k1pt1u/i_keep_getting_prescribed_weight_loss_and_its/
Berberine + Inositol is making my periods lighter and less painful,"I've been on it for 2 months, and had two periods since. Since I started berberine + inositol, my periods have been lighter and less painful. PMS symptoms reduced too, though they're still there (for example, shitty insomnia).

I was only intending to take them to reduce my blood sugar level and prevent prediabetes from getting worse, but to my pleasant surprise it also helped with:

* Reducing constant 24/7 thirst

* Reducing hunger pangs especially at night or after eating

* Being able to practice portion control without being constantly hungry or getting headaches

* More energy, more proactive

* More energy even though I eat less food. It's like I can actually use food as fuel now. I am also losing weight, and saving money from eating less food.

* Less acid reflux (maybe from eating less thanks to portion control)

* Less puffy face in the morning after waking up

* Glowy skin, looks smoother and softer, less dry

* Less PMS acne right before period

* Less tension headaches (and migraines) which often happen during PMS or if I haven't eaten in a while. Before berberine, I would feel shaky and hypoglycemic at the blood sugar level of.... 100. Now I feel perfectly fine in the 80's.

* Surprisingly less sore after exercises and faster recovery, and I feel like I can do more reps, push further, and run longer. Probably because my muscles can actually use glucose as fuel now.

So it means a lot of the PCOS and gyno-related symptoms I've been having was related to either high blood sugar or insulin resistance, and berberine + inositol has been helping with that. I am thinking of trying Metformin as well to see if it helps my PCOS and IR symptoms, because it's much cheaper than berberine.

Hope this info helps someone else out there. I wish I knew about this over a decade ago. I feel like my life was robbed from me by this illness.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/15rcmq1/berberine_inositol_is_making_my_periods_lighter/,19,1692059977.0,/r/PCOS/comments/15rcmq1/berberine_inositol_is_making_my_periods_lighter/
"A rant, vent, confession or something...","Just needed to get this off my chest.

A family member made an unsolicited comment about my body today. A family member that I have not seen nor has seen me in about 5 years. Five years has been a lifetime encapsulated by life, transition, trauma, healing, pandemic, depression...all of which have separated me from who I was then to who I am now.

They said ""you gained weight..."" They trail off, the lilt in their voice a combination of confirmation and curiosity. As if I didn't know. Past me, disordered eating me, unhealthy and untreated anxiety, depression, self-loathing, external validation seeking, and PCOS me would have had an emotional breakdown upon hearing those words from another person. It would have wrecked me in the, and it did--several times over. 

In fact, it previously did. Another distant family friend previously said, drunkenly one time ""I liked you better when you were skinny"". Back then, I crumbled and retreated into the trenches of self-loathing and self-isolation.

But today, I nodded and said ""yeah, I did.""

But I didn't say it in the evasive, pseudo-jokingly way I have said it in the past. It was just casual confirmation: yes, I did.

What people in the outside world don't understand is that this vessel--our body--is imprinted with so many stories that others either cannot read, do not understand, or self-righteously criticize with entitlement and projection of their own insecurities/self-hating internal dialogue. What they do not see is recovery from a near fatal car accident that has changed the physical and mental fluidity of my former body and mind. What they do not see is the overwhelming and mounting stress, depression, anxiety, and trauma that wrecked havoc on and ravaged my insides causing inflammation, emotional eating, inner turmoil, internalized shame and guilt, and social isolation. What they do not see is the countless times I have poked, prodded, surgically attempted to alter, lasered away parts of myself that I was ashamed of and wanted to hide because I believed I was not worthy to be seen.

I'm not saying that I am totally healed. I have a long way to go, but I am saying that me, and all of you, are not reflections of the unsolicited opinions of others on what our bodies should look or feel like.  The you and me in the mirror are reflections of survivors, healing, evolved, loving, gorgeous, incredible, sexy, INTELLIGENT, empathetic humans. 

Rant over. 

Thank you, abundantly, if you took the time to read this. I send you all warmth, love, and healing as we all just try to navigate this life dealing with things that are often just outside of our control.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/v3kisz/a_rant_vent_confession_or_something/,19,1654208435.0,/r/PCOS/comments/v3kisz/a_rant_vent_confession_or_something/
"Electrolysis at last, no updates for a while, reasons. Photos coming soon!","Hi all! I know that there were a few of you ladies interested in tracking my electrolysis process.

Don't worry I haven't forgotten to update, and I'm still continuing with the treatment, however I've only just been back for my second appointment as I decided to get as much hair growth as possible to hopefully get as many hairs as possible in the right part of their growth cycle. This appointment was really important as I should see a visible improvement following on from it. My technician thinks I might only have to trim with scissors between appointments, I'm less optimistic, but we shall see! 


I want to post a really detailed post in a few weeks, which will show you all the progress I've made, and I'll be able to give a frank assessment of the treatment so far. I've documented the process and progress so far with photographs and will continue to do so to show the regrowth following on from this mammoth appointment. 


I'm feeling really confident in the treatment and in myself, honestly it's a little expensive, but I feel great, I can't stop looking at my face in mirrors and I feel like all my skin looks better even though it shouldn't be any different, my chin was far less irritated with acne and in grown hairs, following on from my first quick appointment so I'm praying that's a great sign and I'll have even greater success following on from this week's mammoth appointments! 


So if anyone has any questions they're keen for me to answer, or topics they're keen for me to focus on about the process /recovery let me know and I'll answer them here, or in more detail in my next (photo based) posts.

Does the calories in calories out rule still apply for ladies with PCOS?,"That may sound pretty dumb... so please don't scold me for asking. 

I struggled with my weight starting as a young teen, that coupled with nasty remarks from my mum on the daily about it - I ended up with a eating disorder that lasted the better part of 10 years. 

In my mid 20s I finally had a scan got a diagnosis. (Plus the body hair, acne, missed periods, dark skin - surprised I didn't get diagnoses sooner). 

So a year ago I went into treatment for my eating disorder. I gained a 9 KG and was sitting at a normal weight.

Up until this point I've been eating my required amount of calories, but avoiding specific foods  (bread, starchy vege, dairy, sugar, pasta, cheese) because I know how my body feels when I have that stuff. 

My therapist said that I am not allowed to restrict any food and I need to start eating those things in moderation. I actually shit you not I've put on 5KG in less than 4 weeks. I havent been going overboard on food. I had a bloody eating disorder for 10 years, I know how to track my food. 

My therapist & doctor said its calories in calories out, and that my body must be adjusting to things and nothing to do with PCOS. But I dont believe them?

I don't feel right about it and I'm worried if I continue to gain weight I may slip out of my eating disorder recovery. 

I'm trying to save to go private to see a dietitian and Gyno, in hope that they might tell me my therapist has it wrong. Do you guys think it would be worth it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/g05s0y/does_the_calories_in_calories_out_rule_still/,16,1586728879.0,/r/PCOS/comments/g05s0y/does_the_calories_in_calories_out_rule_still/
I’m still gaining body fat despite diet and exercise. Any tips for weight loss with PCOS?,"TW for talks of disordered eating and negative body image.

I (30F) was finally diagnosed with insulin resistant PCOS this past November 2022 after having my symptoms dismissed by various doctors since 2021 when they first started. I’ve been on Metformin and birth control for several months now, which have really improved my symptoms of cystic acne, hair loss, irregular periods, daytime fatigue, etc.
My problem is I’m still struggling to lose body fat.

I’m fine with the number on the scale, but the issue I’m running into is I’m still gaining inches and body fat. I’ve gone up a couple sizes over the past 2 years, am currently around 30% body fat, and have almost lost my waist completely and now have an apple shape.

I currently workout 4-5 times a week, don’t own a car and walk everywhere, drink plenty of water, get enough sleep, count/log my calories and everything I eat, stay in a calorie deficit, take probiotics and berberine, and recently went on a high protein diet (100-115 grams per day). And still, it doesn’t seem to be working. I have all of this stubborn fat (especially in my stomach) that I just can’t lose. Most of my clothes don’t fit me anymore, I look like I’m a few months pregnant, and I feel uncomfortable in my body every single day. 

Has anyone been able to successfully reverse this? I’m interested in weight lifting and am strongly considering liposuction once I can save up enough money because nothing else has worked for me. But in the meantime, does anyone else have any advice on what I could try? 

For reference, intermittent fasting is off the table for me because I’m in recovery from binge eating disorder. Additionally, I also have Crohn’s disease, so I’m a bit limited in the diets I can choose. Everything doctors normally say to include in a healthy diet - tons of fruits and vegetables, whole grains instead of white flour, quinoa, legumes, nuts, seeds, etc. - I’m actually supposed to avoid. I can’t eat too many of the foods listed without spending half the day on the toilet and experiencing horrible abdominal pain. Carbs are one of the few things I can eat that don’t bother my stomach, which is probably why I’m having such a hard time losing weight. I’ve been able to reduce the amount of carbs I eat, but keeping them extremely low or cutting them out completely is also not an option for me.

My PCOS turned out to be endometriosis ,"Hey everyone! I’m making this post because I’m truly hoping it could help at least one other person out there who’s been left in the lurch by their worsening symptoms. 

I was tentatively “diagnosed” with PCOS at 20 (I am now 25). I was diagnosed on the basis of:
- being overweight
- B belly or apron belly
- dark, male pattern hair growth on chin, jaw and chest that seemed to worsen as I progressed through my 20’s
- difficulty losing weight, and then struggling to maintain weight loss 
- constant cravings for sugar 
- painful, heavy and long periods 
- crippling PMS that would hit 1-2 weeks prior to a period 

Every blood panel came back normal, my internal ultrasounds showed no signs of cysts, and my periods were always very regular and were only abnormal when affected by hormonal birth control. My periods seemed to be less brutal whenever I ate using the DASH diet or a keto diet, and when I did manage to lose some weight I noticed an overall improvement to my health and wellness. Also in classic PCOS fashion, I only seemed to be able to budge the weight when I was prescribed metformin and then duromine, which I combined with walking more, doing strength training and then following that up with incline walks on the treadmill, as well as trying to eat anti-inflammatory foods more often. I’ve lost 15kg, but gained that back in the last 16 months. 

I had a Mirena inserted in March 2023 and my gosh was it absolutely hell. The insertion pain was brutal, the cramping afterwards was the worst thing I’ve ever experienced, and it took 6 months to properly “settle”. After those 6 months, I noticed these recurrent symptoms that I passed off as PCOS:
- sharp pain from right and left ovaries at ovulation but also randomly
- sharp, deep and localised pain at the uterus 
- sharp pain at the belly button 
- cramping pains after orgasm regardless of there being penetration 
- hip and back pain
- lethargy (this improved a bit with the Mirena as my lethargy was related to my cycle which has essentially been put on hold by the Mirena)
- strong cramping during my “cycle” (cycles on Mirena were just as if not more painful than my natural cycle, but I was barely passing any blood let alone uterine tissue)

I had my laparoscopy on the 7th of March this year and am currently a week post-op. I never would have had this lap if I hadn’t have switched to a new gynaecologist to have a routine pap, a colposcopy and biopsy done under anaesthetic, as my IUD experience the year before left me with genuine PTSD and there was no way I was getting in a chair ever again. After describing my symptoms, my Dr suggested we also do a lap as according to him, pain as I described isn’t typically caused by PCOS. Well, he found endo tissue around both ovaries, two spots of tissue behind my uterus and growth on the fallopian tubes. He also inserted another Mirena and has advised that it should hopefully be years before I have any more growth that requires a lap as the Mirena will slow any endo tissue, and he also excised the tissue surrounding the growths so there hopefully shouldn’t be any cells left behind. All I need to do from here on out is focus on getting my weight down to my goal of 90kg, which is ideal for my height and figure, and incorporating and maintaining lifestyle changes that I will finally have the mental capacity, energy, and motivation to upkeep now that I will be free from the pain, lethargy, mental fog and exhaustion associated with my endometriosis.

So, is it still PCOS? I guess who really knows! I’ll have to monitor how my body is feeling after recovery, and I’ll probably bring it up with my Dr when I see him for my 6 week follow-up. I can absolutely update this post with that info when I have it. 

Feel free to ask any questions, I’m an open book! Thanks all for reading 🫶🏻

"Was diagnosed with PCOS on Monday, started meds today and I can’t wait to start feeling better","Hi all. I’m gonna keep this short and sweet mostly because I am exhausted and not sure how much energy I have to put into this lol. 

I was diagnosed w PCOS on Monday in a follow up appointment with a hormone specialist. I had a hormone blood panel done after experiencing what I thought were hypothyroid symptoms. Rapid weight gain/stubborn weight loss (working out, healthy dieting, etc and only losing 10 pounds and being stuck there forever), irregular periods, cold intolerance, brain fog, fatigue.

Anyways, while my hormone levels are all pretty normal, a certain hormone ratio (I’m sorry I can’t remember which one rn I am seriously so tired) indicated PCOS. Doc explained that the symptoms I thought were hypothyroidism overlap with pcos. We discussed treatment (500mg metformin nightly for 8 weeks until we redraw my labs) and Decara (50,000 IU vitamin D because I am extremely deficient) (1x a week for the next 8 weeks)

I am really hoping this is the beginning of recovery. I am so tired of being tired (lol). When I get home from work I have no energy to do anything I enjoy. Even on the weekends I think about reading or painting or sewing or going on a walk but my brain cannot be motivated. It sucks. I miss doing something I love and having the energy to do more than just get through the day. 

I’m pretty new to this whole PCOS thing. I appreciate any advice and would be happy to talk to anyone on this sub and have pcos pals.

Just got diagnosed - Managing with Eating Disorder,"Hi folks,

I’m in recovery from an eating disorder (ED) and was just diagnosed with PCOS today. My doctor believes we’ve caught it early but I’m unsure how to proceed. With my ED recovery, it’s hard to make a decision to lose weight without falling into destructive patterns. 

Does PCOS come as a result of my weight gain or is it the CAUSE of my weight gain? I’m trying not to beat myself up at the thought that this may have been self induced in some way. 

My doctor is putting me back on birth control and wants me to see a nutritionist regularly to discuss diet and exercise changes. I don’t want the symptoms to progress, especially where it relates to fertility issues. Any suggestions?

TLDR: I was just diagnosed with PCOS and have a history of an eating disorder. How do you manage weight loss and does that help deter the onset of other common symptoms?

LONG. Recent diagnosis after 10+ years of being told it was all in my head.,"Yesterday I was angry, then depressed, then more angry, and then finally relieved. I've been struggling with irregular periods for twenty years. I was on the pill for almost 18 of those years, so got a regular period and figured everything was fine. Every doctor told me that it was probably just my young body ""figuring itself out.""  

In my late adolescence and throughout my 20s, I struggled with depression, increasing anxiety, thinning hair, adult acne, folliculitis, and somatic symptom disorder within the past year - actually creating physical symptoms that several doctors claimed were not due to any physical ailment. Great, I'm turning into a hypochondriac. Not wanting to seem crazy, I dealt with all these issues privately for years at a time until a genuine medical condition warranted a doctor visit, then would go through several tests that found nothing wrong, and feel okay for a few more months, assuming all my issues were just in my head. Just need to meditate and do more yoga, exercise and eat more whole foods, self-care self-care self-care. I have always had the sense that I had to work harder at self-care, particularly nutrition and exercise, to maintain a healthy body weight and any semblance of being emotionally well enough to lead a ""normal"" life. Last year, after my amazing husband had a vasectomy, I was able to go off the pill and all my problems relating to periods returned - I got my first period 28 days as expected, then the days between periods increased to 35, 41, 43, 52, 61, then 72 days.  
 
Yesterday I was finally given an ultrasound to further examine irregular menses, and it took them all of five fucking minutes to discover that my ovaries are more than 50% covered in cysts. Research helped me discover that PCOS can cause every single fucking symptom I have ever been told to ignore. Symptoms that have almost led me to seek disability in the past and give up on trying to drive to work. Symptoms that have led me to feel suicidal and hopeless for so many years. My doctor told me that there was never any reason to investigate further since I wasn't actively trying to conceive. A whole new level of anger arises when I think about how many woman with PCOS don't know and never will because they aren't trying to have babies. I sense from this community that many of you also relate to this anger.  

Relief arose when I realized that this gives me a whole new outlook on what I can and cannot control, and new parameters that will help me NOT beat myself up emotionally so much. I've been in therapy for several years and will get to continue with a new path. I've been focused on eating whole foods and regular exercise for about eight years, and now I know that I need a little more recovery time, more healthy whole foods, and a lot more love for myself when things aren't ""perfect.""  

TL;DR doctors ignored my symptoms for years, making me think it was entirely psychological, turns out I have PCOS but no one thought to check since I don't want kids. Was super pissed but now just slightly pissed with positive outlook.

Edit: NOT beat myself up. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/6hfdbu/long_recent_diagnosis_after_10_years_of_being/,12,1497537200.0,/r/PCOS/comments/6hfdbu/long_recent_diagnosis_after_10_years_of_being/
triggered and need support ,"hi !i just got diagnosed with PCOS this morning. I am also in recovery from anorexia ( important part in why i’m so triggered) 
my doctor had said diet changes ( which i already have implemented) and working out and doing weight training. he also prescribed me metformin. 

all my brain is hearing that is that i’m overweight and that’s why he’s telling me to do all this/ what caused it. so i’m very triggered. my sister has PCOS and reassured me they would tell anyone with PCOS to do these things. but being a person in recovery from an ED it’s like my brain isn’t hearing logic 

i hope this makes sense and if anyone has any insight i would so appreciate it 🖤i don’t even get weighed at the doctors because it still is very triggering so this has been a tough day.

"Surgery scheduled, having big feelings about it","I've dealt with PCOS since hitting puberty 27 years ago. I was diagnosed in my early 20s based on the assessment criteria: hirsutism, weight gain, and missed periods. Every time I talked to doctors to try and manage my symptoms, I was either told to just ""lose weight"" or dismissed entirely because I wasn't trying to have kids. (I've always been ambivalent about having them.)

A couple months ago, I started having pelvic pain, and--long story short--I had my first ultrasound, and they found a ""concerningly large cyst"" on my right ovary. So large, that there's barely any ovary tissue. 

Come to find out, this cyst is special: 

It's a Dermoid cyst. Unlike other ovarian cysts that are filled with fluid, this one is made up of excessive/extraneous tissues (they can often contain things like hair and teeth). Apparently, dermoid cysts can show up anywhere on your body, and you're usually born with them. 

So now I'm having surgery to remove the ovary entirely. I've also opted to have a bilateral salpingectomy (removal of both fallopian tubes), since I'm almost 40, I don't want kids, and... well... *gestures at the state of the US*. Plus side, bilateral salps also reduce the risk of cancer in the ovary I'm (hopefully) keeping. (I say ""hopefully,"" because there's a 15-20% chance that it also has the same kind of cyst on it. If the surgeon discovers one, we're just going to remove it also, while they've got me on the table.)

I'm just kind of processing everything, right now. I'm not upset about sterilization: as I've mentioned, I don't want children. But I'm pretty angry that something as simple as an ultrasound was able to give me more answers as to why my body is this way, and that it was never offered to me when I was originally diagnosed with PCOS. I guess they figured since I had the 3 stereotypical symptoms, there was no need... After all the crash diets, excessive exercising that led to sports injuries, spending thousands on supplements and medications, and feeling like my body betrayed me, I could have known about this literal YEARS earlier. It would have saved a lot of heartache.

I'm also terrified of surgery. It's an irrational fear of mine-- logically the idea of surgery has never bothered me and makes perfect sense, but when I think about actually going through it, my lizard brain wants to hide under a rock. The good news is the surgery is laproscopic and outpatient. And my mom is traveling the 700 miles from her home to stay with me and take care of me. 

I guess TL;DR, make sure you're asking your docs for everything you can to verify your diagnosis. 

Also, anybody that's had this kind of surgery, any advice on how to speed/ease recovery?",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1k6evts/surgery_scheduled_having_big_feelings_about_it/,10,1745454381.0,/r/PCOS/comments/1k6evts/surgery_scheduled_having_big_feelings_about_it/
I just got diagnosed with a bigger cyst than I’m used to and I’m not entirely sure what to do.,"I was diagnosed with a cyst on my right ovary that’s about 7cm large. Cysts are not new to me since I’ve been diagnosed with PCOS since I was 17, but I have never had one this size. My gynecologist did a transvaginal ultrasound to diagnose it, and said since the pain was subsiding that we could wait six weeks and do another ultrasound which would determine if I have to have it surgically removed. The pain only bothers me every now and again, but the cyst seems to have caused so much swelling that I look like I’m on the tail end of a pregnancy and it’s killing my self esteem a bit. 

My main questions for people who have experienced this are as follows:

What’s the surgical procedure like? What should I be prepared for?

How long is the recovery time?

Is there any way I can get the swelling to go down in the mean time?

Thanks in advance to anyone who answers!

PCOS and ED,"I'm going to talk about ED(Anorexia and Binge Eating) so if this is triggering to you please don't read. 


I was diagnosed with PCOS 3 years ago, but had been facing symptoms far longer than that.

 My entire life, until about 18, and I have always been overweight and eventually became obese(310+ llbs). When I was 19 I developed Anorexia and lost 160 lbs in 1 year. Which is terrible and I do not recommend to anyone at all. I recovered for a while but relapsed and got down to 114(I'm 5'10  so that is terribly underweight for my body type). As of now I haven't weighed myself in over 1.5 years and have kept a healthy weight. 
The issue stems from my terrible relationship with food. I still bounce back and forth between restriction and binging. This, pcos, mixed with the amount of exercise I do(10-13 miles daily and yoga daily with weight lifting 3 times a week) is so hard to manage and I am at such a loss of how to get it all under control. 

When I was first diagnosed with pcos I was still in hard core recovery and the idea of micro managing my food the way I felt like I needed to was so hard to imagine. When I start to get in my head about that I just end up restricting harder and it just all falls apart. 

I have been on birth control for a couple of years, but decided to go off of it in January because it makes me so depressed. I haven't had my period(no surprise) since. I just began taking myo and d-chiro-inositol yesterday, so hopefully this helps.

PCOS and Eating Disorders,"\* trigger warning for eating disorders \*

I was diagnosed with PCOS earlier this year aged 18 (am now 19) but I've had symptoms since my periods started aged 11. Between the ages of 12/13 to 17 I struggled with an eating disorder, which thankfully I've mostly recovered from now apart from occasional small relapses.

I have lean PCOS and I'm a UK size 10 (I have been bigger). However, I find a lot of the advice surrounding PCOS and weight loss/dietary management to be quite triggering. For me, there's a very fine line between watching what I eat and going into full-blown calorie-counting binging/fasting mode where I feel guilty for eating anything.

I don't feel like I need to lose any more weight. My consultant has been really good about this but I don't see him very often. Both GP surgeries I go to (I'm a uni student) are fairly hopeless and the only advice I'm ever given is to lose weight even though I'm at a healthy weight. The last thing I need is a full blown relapse into my eating disorder, especially as I'm currently more stressed because my uni exam season is coming up and I can never concentrate long enough to revise properly. 

I know there's a correlation between PCOS and eating disorders. Does anyone else feel like this? Does anyone have any advice on how to reconcile eating disorder recovery with PCOS treatment?",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/ffgaj6/pcos_and_eating_disorders/,10,1583690618.0,/r/PCOS/comments/ffgaj6/pcos_and_eating_disorders/
Figuring out a healthy diet with PCOS and ED,"Wondering if there are any cysters out there who struggle with an eating disorder as well, and how they have handled the ""diet"" component of treatment. In recovery from ED, the philosophy is all about everything in moderation and not eliminating certain ""bad"" food groups (because this can lead to overeating/binging). I was diagnosed with PCOS six months ago and the more I search for support online, the more I find a huge focus on the weight loss component and lots of ""NO CARBS changed my life!"" 

I know I can never completely eliminate carbs from my diet because of my eating disorder. But now my eating disorder has latched onto this information and keeps whispering things in my ear like: ""you could get better/lose weight/be happy/find a partner if you just went keto, you're not doing it because you're weak, etc."" 

How do I strike a balance here? I'm finding it incredibly difficult and every time I read another ""keto success story"" my eating disorder makes me feel like shit about it. 

EDIT: I want to add I have no judgments towards people who have done keto and found it helpful. I just know because of my ED it's not going to be a healthy option for me.

Ovarian drilling?," Hi, all! 

Hope everyone is doing well. 

My first IVF failed (0 PGS normal embryos) and my RE speculated it's due to poor egg quality, due to very elevated testosterone and androgens (thanks PCOS!). Due to that, I'm having ovarian diathermy done in April before we go through a 2nd IVF cycle in June/July. 

Has anybody recently had it done, and if so, could you give a few details? I'm mainly wondering about how your recovery was, and if it helped you by normalizing your cycle/hormones/making you ovulate?

"I've had a rough couple weeks, and I just need to vent about this stupid syndrome for a minute.","Obligatory backstory, I'll try to keep it short.

Diagnosed with PCOS at 16 because I had my very first period at 12, and the second when I was 15. I've never had a cyst in my ovaries but every other symptom I exhibit on a textbook level. I've been on/off treatment (birth control, Metformin, Spironolactone, you name it) for about 8 years now. 

Pelvic pain is a pretty common symptom for me. Sometimes when I stand up or sit down, I get a lot of pain in my uterus. Sometimes it's just a tinge of pain in an ovary, intercourse is dreadful and painful. My libido died a long time ago and being in a committed relationship it has taken a toll in too many ways. I went to my GYN, had an ultrasound (internal and external), had an annual and they found nothing. The next step was a Diagnostic Laparascopy.

I had the procedure done and during the recovery portion, where I still hadn't talked to my GYN about everything he found, he referred me to an Endocrinologist. When I got there, she reluctantly ran a bunch of tests (insulin, cholesterol, liver enzymes, etc) and lectured me for over an hour about how overweight I am, how nothing is medical is likely wrong, how I'm killing myself. I told her that I had PCOS, she said 'PCOS is a rule out diagnosis. It's over-diagnosed and it sometimes is a crutch for women who can't lose weight.' I told her about my history, that we had ruled everything out, that I do have liver issues because of the PCOS, that I've been treated. She insisted that I was just fat and that was that. She told me to stay on the birth control if I believe its PCOS and that was the treatment.

Today, I had my follow up appointment regarding the laparoscopy. Endometriosis everywhere. He spent an hour just burning it all off on the operating table. We sat down together and made a plan: stay on the Vestura (birth control, generic Yaz) and skip the placebo week. If the pain comes back, he'll move me to the Depo shot where I won't have a period. He said to expect weight gain on the shot if we go that route, and because of my other medical issues, it could reach 50-60lbs in the first year. We will try that until I'm old enough to have a hysterectomy. Unlike quite a bit of you here, I don't want children and I respect that everyone has a different goal.

Today, the pharmacy called me and told me that the Endocrinologist called in a prescription for me, Metformin ER. I tried to call their office to see if the test results were in, they wouldn't give me any information and she had me set up an appointment with a dietitian... you know, because I'm a giant fat mess. To top it off, the maintenance guy at work that comes around to pick up our garbage midday looked at me, pointed at my stomach and said 'Hey! Happy Mother's day to you!'. I just want to crawl into a hole and stay there forever.

I know that without a period, my PCOS symptoms will go out of control. If I take the placebo week of birth control, my Endometriosis will come back. I feel like my body is a warzone and I'm trapped. I don't feel like a girl, I'll never feel like a woman. I have hirsutism, hair loss, weight gain, you name it. I feel miserable and lost in this disease that I've been carrying around forever.

Bloodwork came back clear but ultrasound shows pcos??,"TW : eating disorder

Hi wonderful community!

When I was 17 my doctor suspected I had pcos. I don’t remember what the bloodwork said at that time, but ultrasound showed lots of cysts in my ovaries.

I didn’t do anything about it in the next years. I’m now 28. I struggle with my weight (a little bit overweight) and it’s very difficult to deal with this. The only way I lost significant weight was when I went through anorexia and bulimia. I’m now in recovery but my ED will always be there. 

I got fed up with this and decided to go back to see another doctor to investigate for pcos again. The ultrasound showed symptoms of pcos, but my bloodwork came back clean. I’m confused and desperate. I was sure something in my blood would explain why I can’t lose weight. Could I still have pcos without a hormonal diagnosis?

can i benefit from low carb without ketosis?,"i made a post around 2 weeks ago, asking what the best thing people did for their pcos was. i was initially completely closed off to changing my diet but after some thinking decided i'm far enough along in my ED recovery to handle a change. so far, it's been great. light sugar cravings but completely manageable. i also now take Omega-3 supplements (along with vitamin D because seattle winters are awful.) and have de-centered my diet from bread and pasta. no restriction mindset has been triggered and i'm actually feeling really well. on a typical day i stick around 60-70 carbs, most of which come from meat and cheese, obviously. i've also been trying to up my protein.

I walked around with a broken foot for a day once but I have passed out from the pain from these cramps.  Up until I found this sub, I thought this was somewhat normal.  I thought I was just one of the unlucky ones who has a more painful period.  I told my doctors but no one said that this was not normal. 

I had relief for about 2 years when I didn't have a period.  The doc tried to get me to go on progesterone but I was so thankful to be cramp free I took the risk of not doing it.   I told my doctor about the cramps and that I would rather risk complications from no period than have the cramps.  I still was not informed that cramps of this magnitude were not normal. 

Years ago I had two cysts rupture.  I ended up in the ER because I didn't know what the pain was.  This is when I first learned I had PCOS.  When discussing my medical history we talked about the cramps.   I still was not informed that cramps of this magnitude were not normal. 

How did I make it 35 years and not ever know this was not normal?  I have a GP, a gyn AND an endo.  How has NO ONE told me this is not normal?   I'm to the point where I want to get an oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy but I'm afraid of the recovery time.  I've always been athletic and worked out and I don't want to give that up.    I don't really know where I'm going with this rant.. I just can't believe how many doctors have just ignored my pain and told me it was normal and that woman feels this.   The months when I actually ovulate I can feel it and it HURTS.  I have to take strong painkillers to actually function when I am ovulating.  This is NOT normal.  None of my other friends have ever vomited or passed out from period pain or have pain when they ovulate.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/f9g30k/so_apparently_having_cramps_so_bad_you_vomit_and/,9,1582660634.0,/r/PCOS/comments/f9g30k/so_apparently_having_cramps_so_bad_you_vomit_and/
Years after diagnosis I finally feel like I'm getting the help I need! I'm so relieved,"

I was diagnosed about 3 years ago when they found a handful of cysts on my ovary on the first go. I've always suspected I had PCOS but was never sure and wasn't really seeing anyone that actually listened enough to do anything outside of throw me on birth control. Which made me fing crazy and my hair fall out.

I love my gynecologists office and every woman in there, but I was getting frustrated. The thing that finally worked for me was the Mirena IUD, but around the time I was due to change it out I started getting really bad cramps and excessive bleeding again. On top of it my right ovary started hurting non-stop, but every time I had an ultrasound they couldn't find anything and my ovaries were surprisingly cyst-free. They switched me to the kyleena for my switch out in hopes I could go longer than 3yrs this time around without issues.

During my ultrasound to check on my IUD they didn't find anything. I waited the full 3 months and instead of getting better, I ended up with a 28 day period. Every time I thought I was done I would start back up the next day. Even though I was frustrated I didn't give up on the office I was seeing, I called them last week and they made an apt for me on Monday.

Monday things finally went somewhere and they found a polyp on my uterus. They explained that I not only have a small uterus from lack of babies, but its also tilted so getting proper imaging on the ultrasound had been a struggle and its very likely I had it on my visit back in April but was missed.

Everybody happened very fast after that, but I was so relieved and finally felt HEARD.  I felt like between the ultrasound and the apt I was in the office forever, but the doctor was amazing. Before I left for the day she had already gotten the in office surgeon to sign off on everything to approve my apt for today (Friday).

The surgeon today was amazing. Actually, everyone was amazing even the out of office anesthialogist they had come in for their Friday procedures. I felt so loved and cared for beforehand and my surgeon and I briefly talked beforehand about how she wanted to make sure I got the news that my bloodwork came back pre-diabetic. I explained i need a new primary care and she gave me the hook up and a paper with several doctors circled that she has a close relationship with. She told my to absolutely throw her name around and they will assure I am in good hands.

I also didn't know their office had a dietitian. I'd been referred to one in the past, but quickly realized they had no knowledge of women's issues outside of the standard. She already sent in a referral to get me approved by insurance and I am so relived that I will be getting help from here on out from people that understand and acknowledge that I have these issues that make everything so difficult.

I am now polyp free and my recovery went way better than I thought. They also switched my kyleena out for the Mirena again. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do but my lovely surgeon made the executive decision for me because the Mirena is FDA approved for successive bleeding. Now fingers crossed that everything else comes back benign!

This got lengthier than intended, so...

TLDR: surgeon that removed my polyp is amazing and gave me the hook up for a primary care and dietitian that understand womens issues and PCOS.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/olyitq/years_after_diagnosis_i_finally_feel_like_im/,6,1626501195.0,/r/PCOS/comments/olyitq/years_after_diagnosis_i_finally_feel_like_im/
PCOS & Ovarian Drilling,"I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 18. I have been through every medication and fertility treatment available. I was getting worse every day. When I got promoted at work, I had to move to a new city. I changed doctors and scheduled my first appointment. Upon seeing the dr. (who was Jamaican, not that it is important but I find it pretty cool ) he told me that he wanted to try something that would have a good chance of helping me. I had what is called Ovarian Drilling, where they made two tiny incisions on my tummy and burned several small holes all over my ovaries. It was a fairly painless process apart from being a little sore for about a week or so. It took me 6 weeks, but for the first time in over a year I had a period that was not medically induced. Since then I have continued having a regular cycle every 28 days and my hormone levels have returned to normal. The hair growth has thinned tremendously, my mood swings are non existent, and I have ten times the energy that I had before. I still have a few days every now and then that I have to take it easy because I am not used to so much activity, but all in all I would say I am on my way to ""recovery"". I still have to lose the 100 lbs put on by the PCOS, but I am working at it one step at a time. I was wondering if there was anyone who had a similar experience with this or even a negative experience?

I'm getting my ovary out! Questions in message. x post to r/endo,"Anybody else had their cystic ovary out? I've got pcos and endometriosis, and my gyno will also be laparoscopically searching for adhesions and endometriosis-implanting-sons of-bitches all through my abdomen. I don't want kids, I'm keeping the other ovary so I don't go into menopause. My gyno is taking the fallopian tubes because apparently most female pelvic cancers are epithelial in nature, arising from the cells from the fallopian tubes. So in addition to being sterilized, I'm also preventing some future cancers.

My questions are these: has anyone on this sub had a uni lateral oophorectomy with bilateral fallopian tube removal? What was recovery like? How long ago was your surgery? How did your ability to lose weight change after the surgery? I regularly gain and lose the same 30 pounds. How big was your cyst/ovary? Mine is as big as a tennis ball. How does the pain compare? Next time I get that cystic pain, I just may take a kitchen knife to it myself. How about facial hair growth after surgery? I may just get laser hair removal if it doesn't go away after my recovery.

Has anyone had surgery or ovarian torsion?,"I'm 26 and was diagnosed with PCOS 12 years ago. I know I sometimes get cysts, usually when I feel one I get it checked out. About a month ago I had really bad pain, couldn't sleep at night, went the next day to urgent care. UC didn't have an ultrasound machine so they sent me to the ER. ER did an ultrasound and cat scan and found an adnexal cyst, made me an appointment with a new gyno and sent me home with pain meds.

Follow up ultrasound has shown the cyst they found is still there and a complex cyst has formed inside the same ovary. The pain comes and goes but gets pretty intense. I'm having my first period in two months and my ovary hurts *so much*.

The doctors have said to wait 8 weeks to check the cyst again, and if it's still there they want to discuss surgery. They aren't willing to say at this point what the chances of me keeping the ovary is.

I'm scared to call them today in case I'm just being sensitive. Anyone else get severe cyst pain with cysts and periods? If I were having torsion, would it be so painful I'd certainly know? 

And for anyone thats had the surgery, did you get to keep your ovary? If not, do you have to take hormones now? What was recovery like? Did it help you or did you just get more problems with your other ovary?",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/4xu7vm/has_anyone_had_surgery_or_ovarian_torsion/,6,1471276397.0,/r/PCOS/comments/4xu7vm/has_anyone_had_surgery_or_ovarian_torsion/
I'm thinking about trying juicing,"I struggle to eat solid foods (not related to PCOS, I have digestive issues) but struggle even moreso getting fruits and veg into my diet, especially because my stomach doesn't really handle uncooked veg, and is iffy about uncooked fruit.

I was thinking, a good middle ground until I can get my stomach and digestive system sorted would be to juice, that way I'm still getting some of the nutritional benefits of the fruit and veg but also am avoiding the added sugar (and added cost, woof) of prepackaged juices.

Do any of y'all juice and see benefits from juicing? Particularly relating to any PCOS symptoms? Do y'all also have any tips about getting more fruit and veg into my diet, any recipes that involve very cooked veg, for example.

\*EDIT\* I realize now that I should have clarified my dietary issues while posting.

I'm trying to cut this down, still probably going to be a lot, never quite figured out how to keep things to basics, probably won't.

* I have celiac, a dairy allergy (I can only have butter or ghee, but it's got to be high milkfat), a peanut allergy, and am intolerant to the sugar in all legumes (though beans are also a fiber issue), onions, garlic, and a handful of other things that I don't like anyway.
* I fucked up and due to that fuck up would spend 7 months slowly getting to the point where I wasn't eating or taking supplements, or really drinking anything, still not 100% sure how I'm not dead, but I'm not, and now I get to recover, 5 months strong in recovery.
* I've had to retrain my body to sort of just...accept nutrients? And solids as a whole. Is and was a painful as hell process, and I'm just getting to the point that I wanted to really start working on cutting back on the supplements I'm taking to stay alive, nothing against supplements, I just really like food and would like to be getting at least most of my nutrients from food or beverages, if possible. Hence, the birth of this post.
* Meat isn't a problem for me, thankfully, I can have meat, as long as it's not a processed meat that's high in sodium.

I'm definitely also looking for suggestions on like simple ways to get veggies in, especially in a kitchen that doesn't have much space and also doesn't have an actual oven, just a toaster oven. I have a stove, though. And a blender that I do not use enough.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/wprxqn/im_thinking_about_trying_juicing/,7,1660649626.0,/r/PCOS/comments/wprxqn/im_thinking_about_trying_juicing/
I’m exhausted.,"I just want to rant about the bullshit that is women’s healthcare. This is long. 

I started menstruating when I was 11, and I’m currently 29. My period has always been heavy and extremely painful, and OTC painkillers barely help. When I was around 18/19 I learned about PCOS and asked my doctor to do tests and my bloodwork showed increased androgen levels so she put me on birth control (Tri-Cyclen Lo). It made a huge difference until I was around 25, at which point I started bleeding heavily again and the pain got worse. I’ve also had several ultrasounds over the years and my ovaries always appear normal. 

My doctor switched me to some stronger BC pills and they did not work. It got so bad that I was bleeding about 3 weeks out of each month, and I finally got a referral to a gyno. Gyno also put me on different BC pills (nonstop without “placebo week”) in the hopes that it would slow down or stop my period altogether. Didn’t work at all. 

After almost a year of this (at this point I had been bleeding almost nonstop for about 2 years) she suggested a Mirena. My gyno also wanted to do a D&C so she suggested that we do the IUD insertion at the same time since I’d be sedated already. I agreed because I was truly at a loss and bleeding so much constantly. I got the Mirena in August 2023. The cramping since then has gotten even worse (tbh didn’t know that was possible considering how intense the pain already was this entire time). I also hemorrhaged for 50+ days from Dec-Feb. 

In February I asked my gyno for a hysterectomy and she said if that was what I really wanted then she would help me, but she needed a second opinion in order for it to be legally authorized (we are in Canada). She referred me to another gyno who called me less than a month later and asked me a bunch of questions (essentially confirming that I understood what the surgery would entail and that I was providing informed consent). She approved the surgery but because we are in Canada the waitlist is over a year long. She also said she suspects possible endometriosis and that if she finds it during the hysterectomy that she will remove what she can, but I will continue to have the pain and might need more surgery later on to continue removing the endo. The hysterectomy would remove everything except my ovaries and I’d continue having other PCOS symptoms (hirsutism, acne, etc.) just without the bleeding. I said I can deal with that, but I can’t deal with the blood-loss and pain anymore. I cried after that phone call because I felt so relieved that someone finally listened to me and my needs. 

In the meantime, the gynos recommended that on top of the IUD, I start taking Aspen-Dienogest daily. It has helped lighten my flow and the pain has improved a little bit (I still get these sudden stabbing pains which knock the wind out of me, but they are less frequent now).  

I remember asking my doctor for a hysterectomy when I was 18 because I knew I didn’t want kids and I felt like going through this for several more decades until I eventually hit menopause was cruel. She said no and seemed almost horrified that I even requested it. When I spoke with her recently she mentioned seeing that I was approved for surgery and waitlisted, and seemed happy for me. I reminded her that she had rejected my request a decade ago and all that really did was prolong my suffering, to which all she had to say was that 18 was too young for such a surgery 🙄 

I’m currently taking the Dienogest daily, still have the IUD (gyno said removing it now might make the situation worse so to keep it in until the surgery next year), and then my dermatologist put me on Spironolactone for my hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) last month. I read that spironolactone is supposed to help with PCOS as well. My derm said that when I stop Dienogest after my surgery, the HS could get worse. The hope is that the spironolactone will help PCOS symptoms and HS symptoms long term. It feels like no matter what, I’m going to struggle for the rest of my life with these 2 conditions. 

I’m just trying to get through the next while until I get my surgery date. I’m terrified of surgery, and I’ve heard the recovery can be brutal. But what’s some more pain and discomfort when I know it will be temporary? I’m also scared that I’m ingesting so many hormones.

I’m so tired. All the time. 

TLDR: After a decade of asking for a hysterectomy, I was finally approved and waitlisted. Doctors have been pumping my body with hormones to get my bleeding under control but it barely works. Women’s healthcare is archaic and I’m scared I’ll suffer forever in some capacity. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1drixe8/im_exhausted/,6,1719689258.0,/r/PCOS/comments/1drixe8/im_exhausted/
Wholesome support system post,"I have been struggling with PCOS for several years. The symptoms I struggle with most are my abnormal periods, excessive facial hair, and inability to lose weight. Over the last two years I have made several changes in attempt to feel better. I walk 10k steps everyday, changed my diet, tried laser hair removal, tried electrolysis, and intermittent fasting.

My two best (male) friends are aware of my fitness journey and my struggle with attaining the results I so deeply desire. My friends and I share our Apple Watch stats with each other daily so they see me burning 600-800 calories a day with little to show for it. Last week I had a consultation with a surgeon to have vaser liposuction performed. I have wanted this for years and it is no secret. Upon booking my surgery date I confided in my two friends separately for emotional support. My one friend (who is completely ripped, no health issues, Hetero male, also related to me) immediately became upset with me and implied that this was the easy way out of putting in hard work. He went on to say it was stupid of me to waste my money on something superficial and went to great length to say how much he doesn’t support me. This hurt. I got off the phone and cried like a baby. Maybe he was right? I just couldn’t imagine waking up every day for another year having to obsess over the lack of progress I was seeing given the amount of work I was putting in. 

After a day recovering from the emotional toll telling my first friend about my surgery, I decided to tell my other friend(queer, chosen family). He immediately became ecstatic and asked for more details and how he could help. Before offering to help care for my dog after my procedure, he said “I know how difficult it is with your PCOS. You’ve been putting in so much work and you deserve to be happy and comfortable in your own skin”. I immediately got *emotional* and asked him how he even remembered or knew how PCOS effected this/me. He said “well after you told me about it I went on Reddit and did as much research as I could to understand what you are experiencing” as if it was nothing! I had to sit down. There are so many instances where I try to explain what it is like to have PCOS to those who aren’t cysters and feel like it’s either dismissed or not taken seriously. This was a big moment for me. 

4 days ago I had my procedure and my friend has stuck by me and been the best hype and supporter I could ever ask for. When I was in surgery he came and took care of my dog. He called me, came to see me, went on short recovery walks with me. We all deserve friendship like this. Someone who goes above and beyond to listen and empathize with our experiences. If you have a friend like this, hold them close.

*edit* I know that this procedure won’t cure my PCOS. But I am excited to have a better relationship with the way I feel in my own skin.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/zocc9k/wholesome_support_system_post/,7,1671300944.0,/r/PCOS/comments/zocc9k/wholesome_support_system_post/
Mini pill experience?,"I'd been on estrogen birth control for 8 years and it was a total dream, cured all PCOS symptoms (no periods, no hirsutism, not a single pimple, PMDD gone, no noticeable side effects). Unfortunately, I fell into the very small percentage of women who develop liver tumors from the pill and can never take estrogen again. It was the only type of birth control I'd ever taken. 

My PCOS symptoms all came back with a vengeance, and regulating my period and acne especially is hard. I developed severe anemia pretty quickly from the periods. My cycle varies from 20-45 days. 

To combat all this and test out a new BC method, I started the mini pill 2 weeks ago. My period has been late even by its usual standards at 65+ days with spotting only, but I have severe cramps. I think it may have also made my hormonal acne even worse. Is this normal for the mini pill? What's the breaking in period?

I'm really on the fence about my options because none of them seem good -- can't have an IUD because of other health reasons, can't have any estrogen BC. Seeing a derm soon to consider spirinolactone or another solution because OTC does nothing. If mini pill doesn't work to help periods and acne, I am considering a hysterectomy for permanent birth control because I'm unsure what else to do. I don't want kids, but it would be difficult to deal with the recovery period.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/uy7hyb/mini_pill_experience/,6,1653571257.0,/r/PCOS/comments/uy7hyb/mini_pill_experience/
Me (25F) dealing with PCOS and my boyfriend (26M),"This is my very first post ever and it seems to be just the place I need to be to discuss this ruthless, incurable stupid freaking disorder that is ruining my life...

Let me start from the beginning...I got my period when I was 16 years old and since the beginning it has been very, very irregular. I would go months without periods resulting in usually only having to deal with it 3 times a year. I guess you could say at that point I was lucky...it sure seems like it to me at this point anyway.

Always--in the back of my mind--I felt like I would have fertility issues because I didn't have a normal period. It was one of those things that I considered, but it didn't really matter to me at the time (I was young). Then..6 years into my (toxic) relationship, I was preggers. 11 freaking weeks and didn't have a clue. Now, this is not a post based on ectopic pregnancies so I will try to make this part short, but I do think it's relevant to my point and situation...

Anyway...after I found out I was pregnant (after a trip to the shore and intense stomach pains) the doctor in the emergency room confirmed that I was pregnant and urged me to make an appointment with my doctor 48 hours from then. At the time, I was 22 and was scared shitless, but kind of happy because maybe I didnt have a fertility issue? Maybe I was actually able to have kids and at the time I thought I was in love with that bastard that I had been with for 6 years already so why not?..Unfortunately the pain intensified the next day and I rushed back to the hospital to find out that I was having a miscarriage (the bastard didn't show up until 4am when I had already been there since 6pm). 6am I was sent home to recover after an hour of the GYN team removing the sac and whatever else gooey stuff was in my stomach that needed to be removed. 

At 8am, I was rushed back to the hospital, as my mom found me passed out and bleeding on the bathroom floor (at this point she didn't know about the pregnancy at all). As soon as I got into the hospital they put me in a wheel chair and wheeled me back for pain meds and monitoring....after hours of pain, guess what they found? I WAS STILL PREGNANT. Miscarried one baby and the other one was somewhere they couldn't find. Maybe it was still traveling in my fallopian tube...they said. That day I went in for surgery where they made 4 incisions to try to find the baby...hours later they came up with nothing. When I woke up the next day, they asked me to discuss with my mom what I wanted to do. As I was slowly and painfully eating breakfast, I discussed my feelings with my mom....I never got to finish that conversation. Somewhere along in our discussion, I lost consciousness. I remember not being able to breathe and my monitor beeping really fast and my mom crying and doctors coming in. Everything was just in and out and such a blur. They took me back into surgery, gave me a blood transfusion, found the baby and terminated the pregnancy. Luckily my mom made a big and I mean BIG fuss about not taking my left ovary and fallopian tube (Thanks mom). I know I ended this part of the story in a rush and there are so many questions left unanswered, but the point is that it was fatal to my life. It almost killed me (and no my boyfriend did not come to visit me before, during, or after my surgeries nor did he take care of me for 8 months during my recovery).

Anyway...with that being said...After briefing you of my history and that experience, I want to bring you to where I am, today. 2 years later (2014), after all of that physical, emotional, and mental torment, I starting dating my amazing boyfriend. In August 2014, we reconnected (we met each other a year prior) and in December we decided to date. December 6, I began bleeding. January 6, I was still bleeding. February 6, March 6, April 6, May 6, June 6..and so on to the present, I am still bleeding. January-May were the hardest. I, almost needed a transfusion. How the hell do you go from bleeding 3 times a year to everyday for practically a year? I have no idea and neither do my doctorS. Somewhere along the way they diagnosed me with PCOS and told me I wouldn't stop bleeding and I have to be on progesterone and iron pills for the rest of my life...don't know what to do and I'm devastated. I can't help but to think that my ectopic played some role in this...either that or my PCOS played a role in my ectopic, which it highly likely as PCOS is very hard to identify and could have easily been overlooked. In fact, most people who are diagnosed with PCOS had it years before they were diagnosed by a doctor.

Anyway, through it all, my boyfriend has been there 100% through the mood swings and bloody massacre in my underwear (sometimes in his bed) and hasn't complained. Needless to say, I love him so much and don't know what I would do without him. My issue with PCOS and my boyfriend is that when I hurt...he hurts. When I get frustrated...he gives me supportive advice, but he is frustrated, too. When I come from the doctors with no answers, he is just as frustrated with the doctors as I am. When I am 1000 degrees at night time, he can't even touch me or cuddle with me. When I am in pain and can't lay down or stand up or sit down, he can't help me. Medicine hasn't helped me. When he wants to go to the gym with me, I'm exhausted...

I know he is going to get tired of this soon...I mean..it's only a matter of time...but what do I do? Going to the doctors depresses me, so I try not to go often(especially because between the copays and medicine it's really expensive--not to mention having an unlimited supply of tampons and pads).I don't want to lose him, but I can't cure myself either. No one I know has ever experienced this---even those with PCOS--so I feel so alone. I don't know what to do. I don't want to vent to my boyfriend because he has expressed that knowing that when I am hurting and he can't do anything about it hurts him...I don't want to be a burden on my boyfriend, but, selfishly, I don't want to lose him either. I feel like a broken dirty plastic doll that is piled under the pretty porcelain dolls on a childs shelf. That's what I feel like when I walk around or go to work and hang out with my boyfriend and their friends and girlfriends. It's not fair.

Sorry for the lengthy vent...I guess what I needed to do was vent and see if there was possibly anyone who has gone through this experience like mine and overcome it? How did it affect your relationship? How are you living with it? Does it get better?",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/3kcrtg/me_25f_dealing_with_pcos_and_my_boyfriend_26m/,7,1441861161.0,/r/PCOS/comments/3kcrtg/me_25f_dealing_with_pcos_and_my_boyfriend_26m/
Struggling with an Eating Disorder and PCOS,"Let me rant for a minute. I am 22 and have delt with amenorrhea (aka not having periods) since I got my first period at 13. I have only had exactly two natural (aka not produced by birth control) periods in my life and I was barely diagnosed with PCOS a month ago. Even though I’ve had an endocrinologist since I was 12 my doctor ruled out PCOS from the get go because I didn’t have hirsutism and was “too thin” to have PCOS. Although I have always had out of control cholesterol and high testosterone, my doctor’s only feedback was to cut out eggs, watch my diet and get on birth control.

Flash forward 5 years – by the time I became a collegiate athlete and serious distance runner that diet advice and athletic-induced body dysmorphia had turned into a full blown eating disorder. At that point, regardless of my undiagnosed PCOS, my body was too thin and undernourished to menstruate. 

By the time I realized I had a problem with excessive exercise and restriction and went into recovery for an eating disorder, my doctor’s recommendation was just to gain weight to get my period back. Over the past year I put my food and body issues to the side and gained about 30 pounds, hoping that the extra weight would finally allow me to menstruate. Now with all that weight on my 5’0 frame my PCOS has developed into full form. I’m hungrier than ever, still have thinning hair, and am constantly battling insulin resistance and lethargy (and now depressive episodes). Even though I thought gaining weight to restore a nourished body would balance my hormones and allow me to finally have a period, I’m experiencing the worst PCOS symptoms I’ve ever had.  

Now after 10 years of dramatic weight loss and gain, body dysmorphia and serious food issues I was finally diagnosed with PCOS. A simple diagnosis from the beginning could have saved me from struggling with my body for the past 10 years. 

I now feel that I’m stuck in a larger body than before and trapped amidst a load of PCOS symptoms. Its especially difficult and demoralizing as most of the advice on how to manage PCOS symptoms and insulin resistance focuses on dieting and completely changing one’s diet. I feel that this option however isn’t available to me as someone who’s had an eating disorder before and can’t trust themselves with restricting their food options or portion size once again. This type of advice has always been tough for me anyways as I generally eat a super balanced diet, almost never eat processed or fast food and typically incorporate all of the foods that are suggested (healthy fats, whole grains, superfoods, etc). 

I feel stuck between a rock and hard place and am overall struggling with the fact that most of my attempts to improve my health have resulted in either a disordered mindset or worsening my symptoms. I feel stuck and at a loss; who knew living a balanced life in a healthy body could be so hard?",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/t3s8u3/struggling_with_an_eating_disorder_and_pcos/,6,1646088420.0,/r/PCOS/comments/t3s8u3/struggling_with_an_eating_disorder_and_pcos/
Settling on abnormal,"I've never had a normal period. Ever. From the age of 13 on, my menstrual cycle has been wack. Started out non-stop. Was put on BC a year later to regulate. Made me feel crazy, so I went off and period went AWOL. Tried Depo and the pill during late teens/early 20s to prevent pregnancy and period always went AWOL after stopping. 

Early/mid 20s I tried to get pregnant in my ""prime"" since my doctor who dx me said it would be very hard to be fertile regardless (married young). Went to fertility specialist. Metformin and clovid did nothing. 6am post coital tests really dampened our sex lives. Gave up after ~1 yr. 

8 or 9 months later, after feeling resigned from natural motherhood and pending a move overseas, I miraculously ""fell"" pregnant after having no period to speak of for almost a year. We had a healthy son. 

There was a few months after my recovery with my first born that I had a normal period. I actually knew what regular ovulation felt like for 2 whole months. Became pregnant again and had my 2nd, a daughter 25 months after my son was born. I consider both of my pregnancies akin to winning the lottery.  

That was almost 10 years ago. My period has not been normal since. Not even close. I've been tracking my period for years and the closest I've gotten is a 35 day cycle, which teases me into believing it will start to ""regulate."" LOL Then comes the 40, 45, 60 day cycles that have been my normal. 

Anyway,  I'm not quite sure the reasoning behind this post, aside from sharing the message that I, after 20 years of PCOS, will never expect normal. I have always yearned for it. It will never happen. All I can do is wait patiently for menopause and try to avoid high-sugar foods, which is the only thing I know that helps my symptoms. 

I say this on cycle day 37. Thinking that because I got my period around the same time last month (and the months before) that it would get better. I am cramping so bad (with no period) because my body is trying to ovulate. If you are like me, then know you are not alone. I'm just looking for some comradarie through the dysfunction. It wouldn't be so bad if not for the feeling of not being a ""normal"" female, the pain, and the other aggravating symptoms that come with this syndrome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/rt4p66/settling_on_abnormal/,5,1640989043.0,/r/PCOS/comments/rt4p66/settling_on_abnormal/
Breastfeeding,"This is just a little information sharing I wish I had earlier (I posted before and deleted as others were rude and commenting that my own personal experience with PCOS was not valid). Remember PCOS presents differently for everyone this information is for those who may share some of my struggles. 

I wish I knew this with my first child. Due to hormones (shocking right?!) Many people with PCOS develop sloping breasts that go to the side and are longer rather than rounder. This is due to hormones limiting the development of breast tissue. As such, when it comes to breastfeeding it can and will limit the amount of milk produced. According to the two lactation consultants I am currently seeing things can be done prior to birth to increase supply as much as possible. So long story short ask for a lactation consultant familiar with PCOS during your prenatal visits!! 

Pregnancy and recovery are difficult enough, I felt so lost and tired with breastfeeding and like I was doing something wrong when really it was just the PCOS, story of our lives right?! For now I combo feed, I make as much breastmilk as I can and then I make sure my baby is fed and healthy by supplementing with formula",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/vsj0dk/breastfeeding/,6,1657087704.0,/r/PCOS/comments/vsj0dk/breastfeeding/
PCOS has made me hate everything about myself,"Getting a PCOS diagnosis and now having to live with these symptoms is ruining my life. I gain tons of weight quickly and out of my control even when I’m trying to lose weight. I used to be a fitness instructor but had to stop because I realized that the high level of cardio that I loved was actually making my hunger and symptoms worse. I am an avid baker and it has been a huge part of my life my whole life and I have pretty much stopped because I can’t have sugar. I don’t drink I don’t do anything fun. I have a history with anorexia and although I was in full recovery for years I am back in full swing with my anorexia voice that lives in my head again. I hate my reflection and I hate how I look. I feel like a complete failure. I’m embarrassed of who I am and I feel like all the parts of me I liked have been taken away by PCOS. My body feels so out of my control and I feel like the way I look was how I told myself I would never look…despite being someone who prided herself in eating crazy healthy and working out all the time. I feel like I look like someone who just does the opposite. I don’t want to go on ozempic because I know that would be bad for my anorexia recovery (so please no comments about weight loss drugs) but I daydream about it. I daydream about plastic surgery in a way I never have (again I’m happy if that makes you happy but that would not be my happy path). I just daydream about being literally anyone other than me. My husband tells me all the time that he loves the way I look and that he loves me but I just can’t believe him and some part of my hates me so much that hearing him say he loves me makes me wonder what’s wrong with him and I know that’s crazy. I miss feeling pretty and not like the ugliest thing to ever walk on this planet. 

I feel like I’ll never feel like myself again or get to do what I love again. I’m constantly hungry and my whole life revolves around food. To the point where I don’t even sleep well cause I’m hungry no matter what I eat. I can’t even hang out without friends unless it’s meticulously timed with meals. My life completely revolves around PCOS and it makes me so sad. I’m seeing a new doctor who is health at every size (HAES) certified and even tho so far she’s nice it’s hard for me to have hope at all. I think I’m just gonna hate everything about me forever. 

Idk what I want from this post I guess other than I just needed to rant somewhere to people who may understand. This is so unfair and so hard and I feel like so many people just don’t get that.

Finally saw a doctor about PCOS. I'm so happy.,"I had gotten a Spiro prescription from an online doctor (Alpha Medical) after extensive blood tests but was desperate to see an actual doctor face to face, get an ultrasound, etc. I've been so terrified of doing so because I don't want someone to just tell me to lose weight and kick rocks essentially. I have a history with disordered eating and have only been in recovery for about a year and a half now. My life finally doesn't revolve around my weight/ appearance/ diet/ exercise and I've never been happier!

I had my doctor's appointment on Wednesday and felt so great about it. An ultrasound showed the appearance of my ovaries is consistent with PCOS (yay for official diagnosis!) and my doctor spoke about potentially increasing my Spiro dosage after my blood test results come back. She was so kind, never once mentioned weight/ changing my diet. The ultrasound also revealed that my IUD is in the (very) wrong place and needs to be replaced. I told my last gyno (the one I saw throughout my teens into early 20s before moving) that sex was painful for me with my IUD and she said ""it'll pass."" Didn't even offer an ultrasound. She recommended against switching my IUD to relieve terrible period symptoms and I marched straight to PP to get one anyway-- best decision I ever made. Her skinny ass would also always ask, in the most condescending tone, ""and how are we staying active these days?"" I don't miss her. Sorry, I digress.

Having a great doctor is such a great feeling. I feel so lucky I got a good one on my first try. My advice to anyone who feels uncomfortable with their doctor-- get a new one. There are better ones out there!

ETA: I also told my last gyno about my hirsutism, she ordered a blood test, and then never ever followed up about the results. I was young and embarrassed enough having to bring up my hair growth, I never followed up and have since been so bitter about her terrible bedside manner.

Questions about tube removal and ablation (unsure on spelling),"Has anyone here ever had either surgery?  If so how did that affect your PCOS? How long where you out of work? Whats the recovery time like?

"New doc, new diagnosis, new plan, new fears!","I was diagnosed with PCOS in 2006 after a few years TTC unsuccessfully. I had ALWAYS had signs, but apparently it wasn't widely known about/doctors didn't care enough to do anything about it. An ultrasound showed dozens of cysts, ovaries ""like a Christmas tree"" according to my RE.

Things happened, now it's almost 10 years later. I had a few early miscarriages, split up with my partner, decided I didn't want kids. Lost about 65 lbs so far doing slightly modified Keto. Pretty regular periods, but still some problems with them/PCOS. Got put on Tri Nessa but after 2 months where I spent more time with a period than without, I sought a PCOS specialist.

Well. I saw him today. After asking me tons of questions AND fielding every single one of mine, he wanted to do an ultrasound, which I had expected. But then out of left field, he also told me he suspects I may have endometriosis due to my meeting all the basic criteria except one. I'm 33, and spent 3 years dealing with infertility docs, and not a single one ever brought this up. So we do the ultrasound, and in addition to the expected PCOS cysts, there is a large, irregular-shaped one that he believes is an endometrial cyst.

He was very pro-Keto (yay!) and took me off the BCP. He Rxd some bloodwork, 2 months of progesterone, and a follow up in a month to talk about laparoscopic surgery to check for/remove any endometriosis as well as ovarian drilling. He said he would likely put me back on Metformin, which I took in my TTC days, but would not prescribe spiro for hair, and that I would likely see better results for hair with the drilling. He said after that point we could discuss either another form of BCP or something like the implant, (he specifically did not recommend Depo and I do not want an IUD).

Right now I'm kind of freaking out. I have a *thing* about doctors as it is, and even more so when it comes to surgery. My main goals are a lessening of the PCOS symptoms and continued weight loss (I want to lose about 70-80 more pounds).

I'm sure there are those of you have done this. I did a search but got a lot of horror stories from a long time ago and freaked myself out even more. Who's done it recently? Has it helped you at all? How was your recovery?

Exacerbated Insulin Resistance after Surgery,"Hi all, I just had my gall bladder remover for reasons other than PCOS, but noticed that I was feeling ravenous and light-headed since surgery. Calorically, I am eating enough food to more than cover any extra energy cost of healing, so I was thinking I might be having a flare up of insulin resistance. I looked, and there seems to be a lot of medical literature on increased insulin resistance after surgery. What I couldn’t find online were any strategies for people recovering from surgery to reduce their insulin resistance. Most of the solutions in the literature are directing anesthesiologists to administer glucose or insulin prior to/during surgery, which obviously is no longer applicable. I called my surgeon, and their NP instructed me to increase my calorie intake to manage the feeling of light-headed hunger, which needless to say, did not seem like great advice to me, as I think this would likely cause me to (1) gain additional weight and (2) slow my recovery toward insulin sensitivity. Any advice on addressing (1) and (2)?",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/w9kwht/exacerbated_insulin_resistance_after_surgery/,6,1658943382.0,/r/PCOS/comments/w9kwht/exacerbated_insulin_resistance_after_surgery/
What’s one small thing you started doing following your PCOS diagnosis to help?,"Hi! Hope the title makes sense. Basically what I’m asking is, what small habit (or mindset change!) did you pick up that helped you see results with weight loss/better managing your PCOS? 

Relatively recently I was diagnosed with PCOS (insulin resistance) and have been working on losing weight + managing my pcos, but I’m so overwhelmed! When I was diagnosed, I was given medication but zero guidance. Since then, I’ve read up on PCOS a lot but I’m so overwhelmed by all the information and everything people say you have to do that I almost feel paralyzed by how overwhelmed I am with it if that makes sense lol. Im hoping that starting with one or two small things will allow me to adjust to that and start seeing some positive changes and then I can keep adding things :)

Also, right before my diagnosis I was struggling with an eating disorder which was the first time I was actually seeing significant weight loss. Since starting recovery, I’ve gained the weight back plus extra of course and it’s so hard for me to try this weight loss/improving my health without veering right back into my ed since that’s what “worked.” So if anyone can speak to maintaining that balance I would really appreciate that too!

PCOS and low heart rate?,"I've always had low blood pressure and low heart rate, and I didn't really think much of it until I joined Orangetheory (a heart rate based exercise class). It takes a ton of work to get into the orange zone, and I can't really stay in it for more than 2-3 minutes. After I've completed an all out, I do a walk and recovery and I'm almost immediately back in the blue zone. I'm usually one of the ones with the lowest heart rate on the board, even though I'm running and some people are walking. Anyway, I'm starting to wonder if the low heart rate is related to PCOS. I have heard some podcasts about how they are considering renaming PCOS to metabolic cardiovascular disorder (or something like that, I forget the exact name). It made me think that maybe the PCOS is responsible for the low heart rate. I know with PCOS we are at higher risk heart disease and stroke too. I'm interested to hear thoughts and if anyone else has this experience. 

Also, for a little extra info, I guess I'm considered ""lean PCOS"",  I'm 5""1' and 120 lbs. I'm also on metformin if that makes a difference. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/5o47zi/pcos_and_low_heart_rate/,4,1484491294.0,/r/PCOS/comments/5o47zi/pcos_and_low_heart_rate/
Trying to heal my pcos as an adrenal type girlie💕,"Hello hello,

See this as a way to romanticise my pcos recovery process hahah! I’ve been through 2+ years of constant, chronic stress which resulted into PCOS symptoms coming back into my life and adrenal fatigue. I’m now working hard on getting better!! (so the moodswings, constant fatigue and lack of enthusiasm can leave this house) 

Are there any other adrenal type girls here or girls who struggle with high cortisol? I would love to get to know someone who I can check in with and update or progress with :)

Okay, TLDR: what I am currently doing:
- I’m trying to eat regularly (breakfast, lunch, dinner. I often don’t need snacks). I used to skip meals or eat snacks as meals and then binge later on, because I was suddenly so hungry. That didn’t help.
- Sleep more by going to bed earlier: 9:30pm-10:30pm in the latest. I get up between 5am-6:30am
- Eat balanced meals: fats, carbs and protein combined
-  start the day with yoga or meditation, if I manage to then I end the day that way aswell 
- I need to get my ass out and go on one daily walk 
- Do not look in mirrors / body check to prevent myself from negative self thoughts (and stress about appearance)
- Read, cook, do anything else instead of screentime. Still looking for more hobby’s! 
- Do Pilates, vinyasa yoga and a little bit of weight training for exercise
- Try not to isolate during this process and actually seek out people even if I’m insecure 
- Use mostly natural skin care / body products 
- Ginger tea and spearmint tea
- Eating mostly hot meals to give my digestion a break
- Learning that not being perfect is okay and to be more patient with myself
- Be vulnerable with people and see that it can be safe sometimes to do that 
- Getting out of my comfort zone and working through fear, so that I have less constant anxiety and stress in the long term 😊
- Moving energy suckers out of my life and put myself first more for once 
- Go to therapy to increase my self confidence and learn how to set boundaries and work through my fears😊

Aaaand food / supplement wise:
I am someone who struggles a lot with constant inflammation / high cortisol and I found that a whole food vegan diet works best for me, because it’s anti inflammatory to my body.

I am keeping an open mind tho (although it’s difficult after 8 years of being plantbased) that maybe a piece of fish or an egg sometimes can be beneficial aswell.

Supplement wise, I now take:
- DCI
- Saw palmetto
- Magnesium 
- Saffron + l theanine (for my low mood)
- Daily multi vitamin 
- D3
- Omega 3
- B12
- pre and probiotics 

If you have any recommendations for me, let me know! And I would love to get to know you all better 💕❤️

Anxious about having an ovarian drilling,"Hi all, Im 37 and TTC. Ive been diagnosed with PCOS and Hashimoto's disease. I've had painful and irregular periods all my life. I've also put on a lot of weight over the years and struggle to lose any weight. I've been taking glucophage and euthyrox for a number of years now after my diagnosis.  I feel as though time is running out for me to have a family. I've only had one pregnancy that ended in a miscarriage. I've been to a few gynaecologists in the past few years looking for help. Recently my doctor recommended another gynaecologist with a good track record for women who are struggling to conceive. I finally saw him two weeks ago. The ultrasound showed that my ovaries are very polycystic. My ovaries had improved in the past after taking Androcur which was prescribed by another doctor. That was however over a period of a year. The new doctor prescribed Femostan which is to be started with my next period. He also suggested that the best option for me is to do an ovarian drilling, thereafter I should TTC within the first month. He also said that my husband should do a sperm count after the procedure.

I'm really nervous about the ovarian drilling procedure. I see from research and older posts that it is somewhat of an outdated procedure. But on the other hand I feel a bit desperate given my age and other health issues counting against me.

Is there anyone that had luck getting pregnant after this procedure? What is the recovery like? Are the effects long lasting?

Advice: Help talking to dietitian,"Trigger warning: eating disorder 

I (28) was diagnosed with PCOS earlier this year after complaining about various symptoms for years (finally met a great doctor who took me seriously - yay!).

I had an eating disorder when I was a teenager and gained a lot of weight when I was in my late teens/early twenties which I assumed was from recovery (although now thinking it might have been the PCOS). I recently started seeing a dietitian after the diagnosis to get help, but I didn’t mention the eating disorder as it was a long time ago and I thought I was fine. The issue is some of the things she’s asking me to try, like tracking calories, weighing regularly, etc. are reminding me of how I was before. On reflection, I should have realised this was going to happen and told her initially but honestly I’m embarrassed by it (it makes me feel like I was weak, which is a whole other issue).

Strength training and lifting advice,"For those of you who started weight lifting / strength training after your diagnosis, did you have a hard time with recovery at first? 

I have attended a couple strength classes, and I really enjoy it - but the recovery (DOMS) lasts for 3-5 days and it’s hard to do any workouts in that time. I’m wondering if the class is just too much for me and I need to ease into it at home? Or is this normal for the first few times and if I continue to go maybe the recovery time will quicken? 

Looking for your experience, I know I’ll probably have to play around with it because we’re all different. I’m hoping to get some encouraging info. 

A little extra info: I have both PCOS and hashimotos hypothyroid. I’m pretty active daily - I either bike, do hot yoga, or go for long walks. I really want to add in heavier weight lifting to build more muscle.

Vegan Keto for PCOS recovery?,"I'm still pretty new on my journey to recovery and have had very little support due to incompetent doctors who did not bother checking my blood sugars 2 before simply prescribing me contraceptive pills for months. I've been vegan for 4 years, not knowing that I was insulin resistant until my blood sugar entered pre-diabetic range earlier this year. I stopped taking the pill and started on vegan keto for 2 months which lowered my blood sugar and inflammatory pain. I then reintroduced some fruit and low GI carbs to my diet but within 1.5months the pains started getting bad again and I'm back to vegan keto.

Thoughts on ultra low carb vs high fibre carbs?,"Hi there fellow beleaguered friends,

Does anyone have any thoughts/ experience / studies on ultra low carb diets vs diets allowing limited high value carb intake for PCOS? (by 'high value carbs' I mean foods with good nutritional/fibre value like oats, Bananas, quinoa etc)

I'm 32, on Metformin and leanish (I have 10lbs to lose). I lift weights 4-5 days per week, and before my diagnosis I would include carbs on those days to support muscle recovery (along with adequate protein). 

Since starting Metformin 6 weeks ago I've limited myself to 50g net carbs per day and find myself really craving carbs on lifting days. To the point I cave late at night, and feel I'm getting into a bad restrict/binge cycle.

Am I able to add some limited carbs back into my diet, or does that make Metformin pointless and weightloss even more difficult? 

I'm conscious of supporting my gut with enough fibre, which I feel I'm struggling with when I'm ultra low carb. 

Thanks for your time and advice!

"feeling overwhelmed by new symptoms, needing lifestyle change part Rant/part Advice","Hi everyone. This is my first time posting so I hope everything I say is alright? 

I'm sorry for the long post! I just wanted to provide context! Topics covered: hair loss, insulin resistance symptoms, hormone belly, diet change, comorbidities 

&#x200B;

I (26NB) was diagnosed about 2 years ago along with endometriosis. I have had endometriosis symptoms since I was probably 13 years old, but only PCOS symptoms for the past 3 / 4  years that started with extremeeeee jaw acne cyclically. I went to the OBGYN for the first time 2 years ago since I was 18. I avoided going because of course the first one I went to just told me I have dysmenorrhea (lol) and to take extra strength midol (lol). 

 I lived with extreme endo symptoms for years before my therapist finally convinced me to try going to the doctor again. When I went to see one, she noticed my jaw acne and my belly and got my bloodwork done. All she did to treat both was prescribe me birth control, but then she found out my family has a history of blood clots. She mentioned some sort of bloodwork I could get done to see if this was something I would have to worry about, but that it could be between ""hundreds to $10,000""???? I just decided not to take it altogether, because wtf? The IUD is also problematic for me with my specific endo issues. 

It was around a 3 years ago (pre diagnosis) I pretty much lost my sex drive, still barely have one at all. Then the hair loss came a couple months later after diagnosis (two years ago). I saw a derm and she prescribed rogaine. As I sit here I just brushed off 10+ strands from my shoulders which I've of course been doing all day. A little later on, the weight gain came super suddenly. I try to exercise but I also have fibromyalgia (yay comorbidity) so it's very difficult to maintain an exercise routine with the fatigue (could barely stay awake today), dizziness, I have to do low impact stuff cause I pull muscles easily ! Now, I'm experiencing what I'm seeing here are insulin resistance symptoms. good grieffff. 

I'm just feeling a tad..... overwhelmed by each new symptom on top of everything else. I'm trying so hard to switch to a low carb diet. I'm vegan and I have been since I was 14 years old. When I see cutting out dairy and stuff being suggested I feel a little hopeless! Like ""dang I already did that"". I eat a lotttt of veggies naturally but my vegan partner eats a lot of carbs with 0 issue, so I'll give in for convenience and feel awful! Like my work was undone with one meal. 

It took me so long to achieve intuitive eating in ED recovery, but this past year that has started to completely work against me with the insulin resistance symptoms. I'll eat a full meal, a carb heavy one, and feel like my blood sugar is crashing. I get shaky and dizzy like I haven't eaten about 20 minutes after eating. I've also gained an objectively significant amount of concentrated weight in my mid belly (and elsewhere but not like this). I had not a CLUE that the specific place where I'm seeing a lot of fat is not only specific to PCOS, but specific to insulin symptoms! 

I guess feeling like I don't know where to start contributes to the overwhelmed feeling, and maybe it's just a struggle cause of how suddenly it happened, and how I didn't even realize it was a real problem. I'm pretty used to feeling bad and having to live with it so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ But I guess I'm just in an adjustment period. 

I've been surfing this forum for a bit and have realized I've never even thought to go to an endocrinologist. That gives me hope, but COVID throws a wrench in that plan which is just... frustrating lol. Has anyone met with an endocrinologist remotely via webcam? I know blood work is necessary initially though ;\_\_\_\_;

I came across the phrase ""metabolic chaos"" and that's straight up how I feel. I just want my hair to stop falling out, to stop feeling like complete physical shit, to feel some semblance of the self esteem I was finally starting to feel! 

I guess with all of this, I first and foremost just need to get it off my chest to people who understand. Especially with how quickly new symptoms can present. My partner and close friends are supportive, but don't have PCOS so I don't really talk about it too much with them. I just ask my partner to be mindful that I'm trying to change my diet and stuff or obviously when they see my symptoms/endo is talked about a lot more.  I secondly just want to finally put my feelers out to people who actually have PCOS if anyone with the same symptoms have any resources or tips they'd be willing to take time to share while I comb through all these posts.

Looking for Advice on Where to Start,"Hello. I (26F) was just diagnosed with PCOS. I feel like I was solely diagnosed because I have irregular cycles which go from 24-40 days and sometimes skip. I have had my thyroid checked 3 times before and nothing came up. My blood sugar on blood tests are always fine. I don’t have acne or hair issues and I’ve never had the ultrasound of my ovaries. So I kind of feel a little skeptical because I thought you had to meet two of the criteria. One symptom that I have that would match but isn’t for diagnostic purposes is that I have a lot of belly weight I’m 250lbs and have a big hanging belly (no shame we give her lover to help her heal). 

My husband and I are looking to try for kids starting next year and I just had my IUD taken out yesterday morning with a new OB/GYN who is the woman who diagnosed me. I’ve had 2 prior GYNs bring it to my attention and a dietician. She told me very matter of fact and when I was like my blood work never comes back with anything she was like “it doesn’t need to.” And then told me if I don’t get a period in the next 4 months to come back.

Then I scared myself by looking up that 70-80% of women with PCOS have infertility. 

I feel like I need some sort of game plan. I’m definitely down for some weight loss, I’m just also in recovery from a lot of disordered eating so I don’t want to put too much pressure there. I’ve also already been increasing my movement and have never liked running or stuff like that so I’m good there. I just feel a little lost though outside of that the OB/GYN rushed me out of there so quick she was still talking as she was walking out the door.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/121ihmq/looking_for_advice_on_where_to_start/,6,1679742314.0,/r/PCOS/comments/121ihmq/looking_for_advice_on_where_to_start/
Just diagnosed. Feeling a little blue.,"I was just diagnosed with PCOS yesterday. In a way I am relieved as I started having symptoms 6 years ago and I had no idea what was going on. I started gaining weight, getting cysts, feeling depressed and out of control. I started feeling so ashamed of the way I looked, I didn't want to go to parties or see people. 

These past 5 months have been horrible. If there is such a thing as a ""PCOS flare up"" I feel like I've been having one. 

My M.D. prescribed Metformin - starting with 500mg and moving up to 1000mg. I also plan to supplement the protocol with Inositol, Vitamin D, Magnesium, B12. She also recommended taking low dose Naltrexone. 

I was just wondering if you had any helpful tips for getting started on the road to PCOS recovery. It feels like a long and daunting journey right now.

PCOS since I was 16,"Hi eveyrone. I found this subreddit randomly yesterday. I was pretty excited to find it as there are not many people that I know that have and struggle with PCOS. 

So I was diagnosed officially with PCOS when I was 25. However, symptoms started between the ages of 14-16 yrs old. I grew up in a super small town where the doctors knew dick all. I started my period when I was about 11, but then it stopped completely between said age years. I remember thinking ""Yesss!! This is awesome!"" But then I was like wait this is kind of concerning too. Our family doctor told me that as long as I was having my period every 3-6 months then there is nothing to worry about. I'll be fine. Whenever I did have my period, it was embarrassingly heavy, painful, and passed clots all of the time. I was also having weird issues with my vagina too. Like, I would try to put in a tampon, but it would pop right out again. I had no idea what was really going on. 

When I had graduated from college and had real heath insurance, I went to go see an OB/GYN.  At this point in my life, it seemed normal to me to not be able to have a pap smear and they would always order things like vaginal ultrasounds (no fun super uncomfortable). When I did have a pap or an ultrasound, it was always undeniably painful. So the MD that I had seen around the age of 25, he said two things: i think you have PCOS. we'll order labs. Did you know that your vagina is thickly sealed with  a membrane that is thicker than the hymen? I didn't know the later, and the labs I had done releveled I did have PCOS. So he ordered oral birth control and he said, ""I think it would be better if you considered surgery to remove the thick membrane. It will make sex a less painful experience for you and your future partner."" So, I had decided to have surgery and although a painful recovery it helped a  lot for my future. 

When I was about 30ish, I had seen an endocrinologist and he had again confirmed that I had PCOS. I then saw another OB/GYN as at the time I was struggling with migraines. The OB said that it would be beneficial for me to have an IUD for hormone control and help with my migraines. So I had my first IUD and then had another placed 5 years later. That one fell out, and in January of this year I had another placed. That one recently fell out almost and it was super painful. As recent as last week, I had that IUD removed and Nexplanon placed. I am curious about how it will work.

Side note, the surgery on my hymen/vaginal area helped a lot. It made my female exams more comfortable and of course later, sex a lot more comfortable. Any way that's my story. I am curious if anyone else has had surgery like I had or if I am just weird. Have a good one!",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/nhxw55/pcos_since_i_was_16/,3,1621617715.0,/r/PCOS/comments/nhxw55/pcos_since_i_was_16/

Finally have surgery booked but looking for advice,"Hey cysters, first post so be nice haha.
I've been battling with pain from my abdominal area for years, ER trips constantly only to be given endone and the advise of ""it's just your PCOS you have to live with the pain, nothing we can do"".

Looking for advice on discussing concerns with ob/gyn,"**Content Warning for the following topics: 
weight gain & loss, infertility, brief mention of Eating Disorder Recovery, mention of fertility treatments, pregnancy complications, miscarriages, HELLPS, PPD & PPA**

I’m currently 20 years old, I was diagnosed with PCOS at 16 after telling my doctor I hadnt had a period in about a year  after receiving both a normal abdominal ultrasound and transvaginal ultrasound as they discovered a large number of follicles on my ovaries. I was told infertility and potential pregnancy complications would likely be something I experience in the future with increasing difficulty around 25y/o+. At the time I was not ovulating and hadn’t in a bit, birth control was advised as I was sexually active and didn’t want to get pregnant on accident without any idea because i didn’t have a period to be a warning sign.

 I was on nexplanon for 2 years during those two years i gained weight, the weight gain was not birth control related just ED recovery with serious weight fluctuations but I have lost over 60lbs since June of 2022, 35lbs of the 60lbs since May of 2023, i got the implant removed in October of 2023 because I was having periods for the first time in over 3 years when the birth control was removed I was told the periods were not because of ovulation just hormonal changes. 

When I got off nexplanon I had one period around the same time I was getting them in the last couple months i was on birth control. Well it’s now January and I have continued to lose weight anywhere from a slight change to few lbs a week never gaining the previous weeks weight back (I have in no way been trying to lose weight nor bragging about weight loss just trying to give you an idea of my current weight changes I’m 5’4 and 190lbs currently) 

I do not have many of the same symptoms that brought up concerns and eventually lead to my PCOS diagnosis when I was 16. My only concern is sporadic light bleeding lasting anywhere from a few hours to a couple days it’s not on any type of schedule just some days i’m bleeding or spotting for a few hours or here and there for 1 or 2 days then somedays i have no bleeding at all. I take a pregnancy test every 2 weeks to check and I am not currently and have never been pregnant. The bleeding is not heavy like my periods were when I was 11-14 and it’s not completely absent. I don’t have excess hair growth or acne like before either. I brought these concerns up with my ob/gyn I was told I was not ovulating and have likely not ovulated in years even before my diagnosis at 16. She followed this heartbreaking news by telling not to worry about my concerns if I wasn’t trying to get pregnant at this very moment because there’s medical assistance that will help me ovulate and fertility treatments available.  She knows I’m not trying to get pregnant like today but that me and my partner were hoping to start trying later this year early next year. 

I just really want to see if there’s anything other than just jumping straight into inducing ovulation and fertility treatments that any of you recommend or if you might have tips on how to approach this topic with an ob/gyn who seems to push medical assistance straight away. 

It’s important to note infertility issues are very prevalent in my family all women my mother older sister aunts and grandmother have had struggles conceiving and all encourage me to seek help for these concerns BEFORE actively trying to convince because fertility treatments do not work for everyone and have lead to pregnancy complications such as several miscarriages for all women in my family, lead to my mother developing HELLP Syndrome while pregnant with me, several other health complications during and after birth as well as severe postpartum depression and anxiety. These medical interventions are also very expensive and I worry about them being used before trying anything else because I worry I spend so much money trying over and over that in the event they prove to be unsuccessful it would be some time before me and my partner would be financially and emotionally ready to look into other options.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/19d5ivh/looking_for_advice_on_discussing_concerns_with/,4,1705955540.0,/r/PCOS/comments/19d5ivh/looking_for_advice_on_discussing_concerns_with/
Ovarian Drilling Recovery,"Hi y'all!

I'm newly diagnosed, had gone to OB for sterilization and also for not having a period for about 8 months. Since hormones all came back normal OB suspected possible PCOS and while she was in there for the sterilization she did see cystic ovaries and did ovarian drilling along with a D&C to remove the lining that was built up in my uterus and also found a few benign polyps.

This was a little over a month ago and I started spotting a few days ago (yay period finally!), but today I'm feeling stabbing like pains in my left ovary. I'm just wondering if anyone else has had the drilling done and had the same pains or any complications later in the recovery process.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/o3o1c8/ovarian_drilling_recovery/,3,1624131356.0,/r/PCOS/comments/o3o1c8/ovarian_drilling_recovery/
My first laparoscopy to pop some cysts (March 10). What can I expect?,"Hi everyone,

A while ago I wrote in this subreddit about being diagnosed with one pretty large cyst (was told it was 4cm by my doctor but looking at my records its actually 5.2cm), and one smaller one (2cm). I also have tons of PCOS symptoms but my doctors have always been dismissive when I bring it up. One even put me on metformin at 19 but wouldn't diagnose me \*eyeroll\*.

Anyway, my primary doctor was ridiculously chill about my cysts and said that they were normal for a woman my age and that it would just pop on its own at some point. They said this even though the large one would get so painful that it would even affect my walking around my ovulation window. I sought out a second opinion from an gynecologist who, within 5 minutes, told me that my symptoms were concerning and I needed the cysts popped asap through a laparoscopy and my doctor didn't know what they were talking about when they said that the cyst would ""just pop on its own"".

I'm relieved that the cyst will be gone and I won't feel the discomfort/ pain anymore! However, I am a little nervous about the surgery as I haven't had surgery before.

For those who have had the surgery done before: What can I expect? How will I feel afterwards? What's the recovery time? Will I have a scar? Is there a risk that my fertility will be affected?

Regarding more positive side effects: Will the firm bloat at the bottom of my abdomen possibly flatten out? Will it affect my hormone balance? Will my periods be less painful (they are very painful right now!).

Looking at my symptoms I am convinced that I have had cysts since I was 15/16 so I'm not too sure what is just ""my body"" and what is actually the cysts so I'm wondering how much my body may change after the surgery if this is the case (the firm bloat etc.)

Any advice or reassuring words would be greatly appreciated as I am a little nervous :)

Ovary removal recovery time?,"Hi! I had a hysterectomy two years ago but kept my ovaries so I didn’t go into mechanical menopause, which IMO ended up being a mistake because of my PCOS.

I can have him paged but I feel like that’s a little silly to page him for a question like this. So I was just wondering if anyone had a recovery timeline for an ovary removal?

Progress Update + My PCOS experiences!,"Hey y’all! This community has been so helpful to me—I’ve been a lurker. Reading other folks’ stories and experiences has helped me learn about PCOS and what my body and brain need to be healthy. I thought I’d come out of lurking mode and share my experiences too!

I’m 33, AFAB, white, and able bodied. I’ve been married to the sweetest, kindest person for almost four years and I have really incredible friends. CW: brief mentions of suicidal ideation.

I was diagnosed with PCOS and PMDD in November 2024 after years of fluctuating weight, intense back pain, irregular periods, suicidal ideation, dandruff, fatigue, low (or no) libido, depression, irritability, beard and chest hair growth, nausea, dizziness, etc. 

FIRST, what was most helpful in getting my diagnoses was journaling my symptoms for years—I use Cycles Journal—and it helped me see just how much pain I was in and how fatigued I was. I’ve always had a tough time trusting myself (“The pain wasn’t that bad” or “I must be imagining it” or “I’m probably just lazy”), so being able to see the patterns in my symptoms was MASSIVE in going to an OBGYN ready to advocate for myself.

I’ll group my experiences by Meds/Supplements, Food, Physical Health, and Mental Health (though they’re all connected, wow!)

MEDS (started in November unless otherwise noted)

-Loestrin (hormonal birth control) - I know many folks don’t do well with birth control, but it’s been huge for my PMDD. I ran out once and within two days my suicidal ideation came back

-Inositol (I use Opositiv’s Cycle Support) - I ran out for five days and my fatigue, dizziness/lightheadedness, nausea, and sugar cravings came back STRONG. Taking inositol has given me so much more energy, and has enabled me to move my body consistently, I love it so much. It’s BUT folate toxicity SUCKS so I’ve learned to stick to the serving size :)

-vitamin D3 + K2 - I had a vitamin D deficiency, my levels are up to normal range now, and since I started supplementing vitamin D, my super intense dandruff (potentially sebhorreic dermatitis) is almost nonexistent

-berberine - I use Wholesome Story’s berberine (learned about it here on the PCOS Reddit!). I started it Feb 18, going to stop taking it in May to avoid long-term stomach damage. It controls my blood sugar in a big way, and I’ve got to be careful about when I take it and how I eat. I always eat something or have a protein shake around 30 minutes after I take it. Once I took it after eating and my blood sugar crashed HARD. 

-Maude’s libido gummies - these have fenugreek, which is supposed to help with blood flow. I don’t know how much these have made a difference, since, honestly, finally loving my body has helped my libido more than anything else. Of everything I take, I don’t worry if I run out of these.

-Magnesium - I use Natural Vitality’s calm gummies, take four before bed. I don’t sleep as well when I don’t take these, especially when I move my body a lot. From what I understand, this helps break down/process cortisol.

FOOD

I won’t get into the detailed specifics of what I eat (I think there’s a lot of “bad vs good” food conversation everywhere, and I know it’s not helpful for me! So I try to think of foods as morally neutral, and I think about whether they’re helpful or not helpful for me. I’ll name categories of stuff that’s been helpful/unhelpful, just remember we all have different bodies and there’s no one size fits all! Some of the signals that helped me learn about how food impacts my body:

-inflammatory pain: I get a really specific pain in between my shoulder blades when I have unhelpful foods/drinks. Alcohol and refined sugar are big culprits of this for me. 

-bloating/puffiness: maybe this is another type of inflammation, but what triggers this is dairy and saturated fats

-sugar rush: high glycemic foods (like potatoes, womp womp) make my face feel like I ate a bunch of sugar. It’s wild.

-feeling *too* full: for the most part, helpful food doesn’t make me feel that “oof” feeling after a meal. I feel satisfied but not packed, and I don’t get tired after meals.

Examples of helpful foods for my specific body: legumes, whole wheat pasta, fruits, veggies, tuna, salmon, avocado oil, 80%+ dark chocolate, peanut butter (all natural), kimchi, sauerkraut 

Examples of unhelpful foods for my specific body: alcohol, anything fried, refined sugar, dairy, bread

As I’ve changed my diet, my tastes have changed! Really dark chocolate tastes sweet to me! And, it’s important to name that this isn’t all “willpower.” I think the inositol really helped me manage my craving and make these changes sustainable. 

The other thing that’s helped is learning to think of my body as my home. I’ve been so “at war” with my body for so long that I never learned to listen to my body or care for it. I always held my mind as separate from my body and wow, hey, turns out they’re all part of the same system. For me, “punishing” my body because it was too big or too weak or not enough never worked. Instead, I try to think about what kind of fuel I need to live the life I want to live.

So I have protein shakes every day, too! I use Ora’s vegan protein because Whey doesn’t agree with my body.

EDITED TO ADD: I know I am in a calorie deficit, but I don’t track calories because I have a history of disordered eating and tracking calories sends me down a dark road. I fuel enough to feel strong! It’s a feeling it out sort of thing—if I’m irritable or weak or lightheaded, I haven’t eaten enough. I’d also much rather eat more than I need than less, these things take time.

PHYSICAL HEALTH

At my heaviest, I was 213 pounds (I’m 5’9”). At that point (September 2023) I was diagnosed with high cholesterol and put on a statin, but no inkling of PCOS. I made some diet changes and tried to work out consistently, but I still didn’t have the energy to stay motivated or the strength to keep from getting injured.

I was able to get to 190 on my own, but things stalled out and still fluctuated quite a bit. When I got my PCOS diagnosis and started taking the supplements and meds I described above, everything changed. Being able to manage my PMDD meant I could be more consistent, and having energy meant I could finally build strength. Here’s what I’ve been doing for movement: 

Starting in November I rode an indoor bike for 30 minutes at high intensity for 5 days a week.

In December I upped my riding time to 45 mins 6 days a week

January I upped to 50 minutes 5 days a week  and started adding 10 minutes of seated pushups and resistance band exercises while on the bike

February I upped to 60 minute rides 5 days a week and began adding 30 minutes of strength work 3 days a week

March I kept that routine going until I BURNT OUT — TOO MUCH CARDIO! I was exhausted. I took 4 days off and came back feeling much stronger.

NOTE: it’s so easy for me to think “I have to move my body every day and do the MOST and go the HARDEST” and wow it’s actually so harmful to do that. I also think that learning to trust my body (my exhaustion is not always because of PCOS, I’m exhausted because I’m in a body that needs rest) and learning the differences between fatigue and tiredness, wow. But learning to work hard AND be gentle is a balance. 

Now, in April, I’m pulling way back on cardio and focusing on strength. There are so many threads on here that say “focus on strength!” And I wish I would have listened earlier!! I’m doing the following routine:

Monday: 30 mins core, 20 mins bike
Tuesday: 30 mins upper body, 20 mins bike
Wednesday: active recovery (30 mins mobility work)
Thursday: 30 mins core, 20 mins bike
Friday: 30 mins upper body, 20 mins bike
Sat/sun: rest or riding bikes around NYC

 My results so far are:
- 165 pounds (down 25 pounds since diagnosis, down 48 pounds overall)
- I’m way stronger. I can carry groceries, carry my suitcase, do yard work, etc. with more ease and safety. 
- I feel capable!
- I feel good—less pain, better posture, and clothes fit better
- For the first time in years, I like the way I look. I wasn’t sure that would ever happen again!
- This one was wacky, but I don’t smell the same. My body odor was a bit rough before November, and my bellybutton was stinky! Now, no belly button stink and my body odor is only noticeable if I get really anxious!
- My hair is stronger and I shed less
- Dandruff is nonexistent 
- nails are stronger
- My ankles don’t swell when I walk
- My joints don’t hurt

…I’m about 15-20 pounds away from my goal weight, but I’m already trying to transition to a “strength building” mentality from a “weight loss” mentality so I can set myself up for consistency.

MENTAL HEALTH

wow wow wow this one is huge. And, there are so many factors that go into this—but having consistency in my hormones has helped me keep consistent routines, even if I don’t feel like it! I journal every morning (shoutout Cycles Journal, I love it), work out, stretch, and shower all before work. This felt indulgent at first, like I was so self-involved to have a three to four hour routine in the morning, but it’s been such a lovely way to care for myself and my body. 

The confidence that comes with weight loss and muscle gain is really nice, but most of my confidence is coming from feeling like I can operate in my world in a more effective way. I can have more fun, I’m a more present friend, I’m better at my job, my brain fog is gone, I’m less scared of the world and of myself, and I have so much more energy. I’m a more present partner, and I really do believe now that my body is my home and that I deserve a nice home. Getting a diagnosis and lurking on this subreddit have been life changing.

Also! I didn’t do any of this alone. Friends, my partner, an OBGYN who believed me and my experience, the internet, the right meds, wow—I think we have a habit of thinking this is about willpower and morality and people who get this stuff “figured out” are better than folks who don’t and that’s so brutal.

Also—I wouldn’t say that I’ve “reversed” my symptoms. If I get super stressed, my symptoms flare up. This is a chronic condition that I’m planning on managing for a long time. If that changes, I’ll update this post!! 

I’m happy to talk about any of this stuff, and I’m so grateful to other folks here for sharing their experiences.

Tell me about your D&C?,"Hi all. I've been lurking here for a couple of weeks, first time poster though. 

I was diagnosed with PCOS young (15) my symptoms were mostly managed with birth control and metformin on and off for years. 

The last few years unfortunately have been rough and I went off all meds and haven't seen a doctor (until recently) for almost 4 years. 

For the past 10 months now I've had constant bleeding ranging from spotting to bleeding through a tampon, pad, clothing, and all over my car seat in seconds with clots the size of my fist. I finally saw a doctor last month and after some testing... she wants me to get a D&C to remove all the ""thick vascular"" endometrial lining that has built up. 

At 29, my partner and I are starting to think about having children, I know it's a ways off but I'm scared about cancer and needing a hysterectomy or something. And, in the more immediate future about the D&C. I know I will be put under for it... but I'm still so nervous. ☹️

Doctor was not helpful…,"Today i went to my second endo. Off the bat she told me that “pcos is caused by being overweight” and then went on to tell me to never eat past 7, only drink water, and to limit my calories. 

Im in recovery from an eating disorder and i made this super clear off the bat, in my chart and in my introduction of my background. 

Im open to losing weight but i’d prefer to focus on making lifestyle changes (exercise, better sleep, balanced nutrition). Not just cutting calories. 

Also, even when i was at my lowest weight in the depths of an eating disorder, i still had pcos and terrible acne.

Binge Eating and PCOS advice,"I have been looking at Binge eating recovery advice online and a prominent one is to eat whatever you want without feeling any guilt about it. Naturally, your body will stop feeling guilty and suppressed, leading to fewer binges. However, as someone with PCOS and is insulin resistant, I feel like I got hit by a train after I eat starch. That is the main thing I crave and binge. 

Does anyone have advice on Binge Eating recovery with PCOS? I have no idea how to intuitively eat because it feels like my brain is just screaming ""CARBS CARBS CARBS."" I am not clinically diagnosed with any mental illness, but I do have pretty intense mood swings that certainly contribute to this negative feedback loop.

Laproscopy surgery!,"Hey! 
So after many drs appointment, specialist appointment 2 trips to the ER, missed days off work a cocktail of pain killers, nerves blockers, 4 ultrasounds endless blood tests and a full year of severe abdominal pain i have FINALLY been booked in to have laproscopy surgery aswell as c&d. So i have Pcos but they are unsure of endometriosis. 

My question to the lovly women here is, have you had this surgery? How was your recovery time? Much scaring from the cuts? And most importantly did they find what was causing you pain and was the damage bad?

Thank you in advance!! Xxx",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/42r42k/laproscopy_surgery/,4,1453808093.0,/r/PCOS/comments/42r42k/laproscopy_surgery/
Ablation question,"Hi, my wife has PCOS and is having ablation surgery done today.

I have now been on my period for 8 months. Now with a Von Willebrand's disease diagnosis (along with my PCOS and Endo) my doctor is now willing to preform a ablation and tubial ligation on me! What can I expect?,"Hey guys. It has been a brutal 8 months. Feel free to check my post history for context. But here is a brief history of what happened leading up to today:

(Perhaps I should first specify I am 23 and have never been pregnant.) 

1. Was bleeding for 3 straight months. Very heavily.


2. After many tests and ultrasounds, was diagnosed with PCOS. In October.


3. Was also suggested that I might have a stage 1 or 2 case of endo because of the thickness of my uterine lining (16mm) and other painful symptoms.


4. Had IUD Inserted mid October 2014.


5. Bleeding got CRAZY heavy.


6. Could feel some soft of mass coming out of my cervix. Had polyp removed in...early November, I think it was. 


7. Took several courses of Progesterone and Estrogen. Over these months. As well as iron pills, and I also had a iron infusion. And I also saw another ONGYN who specializes in endo and she was of no help. She suggested removing my IUD in 6 months and using nuva ring (my regular OBGYN disagreed.) 


8. Was tested for endrometial infection and given antibiotics anyway, even though the results were negative. Took those. Kept bleeding. Finished these early February. 


9. Was hospitalized for toxic shock syndrome. (Sickest I've even been in my life.) Because I am bleeding buckets and have been for months, I left a tampon in and unknowingly inserted another, pushing that one back. After 2 days I was REALLY sick. Antibiotics and a hospital stay for that.


10. Saw a reproductive endocrinologist who recommended I see a hematologist and also gave me more hormones. Finished another two week set of estrogen and 10  days of progesterone, to no avail.


11. Saw a hematologist. He thinks I have Von Willebrand's based on my tests. He suggested I go through with my ablation (that I desperately wanted but no one would do it because I'm young) and that will hopefully stop the bleeding. If not, he wants me to see a specialist for rare bleeding disorders.


12. With my cardiologist's help (I have POTS and faint all the time and this has been destroying my body) my reproductive endocrinologist (who is the guy to see in my network about these surgeries) agreed to to my tubal ligation and ablation..

What can I expect recovery wise and procedure wise? Symptom relief wise?

Ozempic,"I’ve been struggling to lose weight since 2019 (I was finally losing weight but pandemic happened and I got off birth control) and I also popped out 2 disc on my back last year so I’ve been in recovery since. 

Since my physical therapist told me to lose weight to have less weight on my back but bc I have pcos it’s been a struggle. I was wondering if ozempic is an option or if anyone has been on it? How do I go on it, any weight gain after being off it, does the weight come off quickly or slowly, will I need to be on it for the rest of my life?",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/zqh2j4/ozempic/,4,1671518656.0,/r/PCOS/comments/zqh2j4/ozempic/
what's the best thing you've done for your PCOS?,"not sure what to flair this as, mods feel free to change


*please do not talk to me about weight loss or any type of dieting. it's not an option and my doctor is against me pursuing it. not to mention i am still in recovery. at this point in time i follow Intuitive eating. i naturally lean away from carbs and dairy. what is the best thing you've done for your pcos OUTSIDE OF CHANGING YOUR DIET?

i'm 17 and pcos runs in my family. i've never had a consistent period since i was 13, and my struggles with body acne and body hair have gotten worse since. i also have mood problems because of it. since 2018, i've developed a 6cm lump in my breast- it deflates when my period comes, so i came to the conclusion on my own that it's hormonal and not cancerous, and in 2019 i saw a specialist doctor who agreed with me on that. i didn't get help till 2019 because i am overweight and my GP just hates me i guess(had a medically recognized ED and she still would just send me home with 20 page myplate printouts and tell me its my weight, despite me being a very active person throughout my teens and even losing tons of weight due to Anorexia). but i finally got a referral to a women's specialist for my ED and she immediately got my blood tests done as soon as she saw my stomach trail haha. 

i'm looking into things I can do to improve my life with PCOS. i have considered getting an IUD and medication. i tried medications once and i had pain so great i was literally praying to god to let me pass peacefully. i never took it after that and unfortunately lost contact with my doctor.

i've just re-contacted her. she doesn't want me to do any sort of dieting or weight loss 1) because I already have a good diet and 2) i have a history of ED. Exercise is limited because of pain with my breast size but i'm not super out of shape.

so, what's the best thing you've done for your PCOS? i just need to hear from actual people not google. i'm scared that i'll never be able to manage this, and i just want to reach a point where my body feels alive again. I miss being active and feeling good in my body.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/jmeuzn/whats_the_best_thing_youve_done_for_your_pcos/,3,1604282320.0,/r/PCOS/comments/jmeuzn/whats_the_best_thing_youve_done_for_your_pcos/
Had Endo ablation and question supplements ,"New poster but I've been in the community for a while lol. 

I'm semi newly 'officially' diagnosed with PCOS as of a few months ago but had endometrial ablation completed Sept 2023 and it's been the best decision for my health. I consider myself to be one of the lucky ones that recovery was easy and minor cramping/bleeding but now no longer have periods at all. 

The only medication I am on is for BP and high cholesterol- currently taking Losartan, prescription omega 3, and Atorvastatin.

Due to recent official diagnosis of PCOS, I have been taking Wholesome Story inositol but will be switching to Theralogix version due to higher dose and cheaper option in the long term usage. I also take the Wholesome Story NAC -(I wished theralogix would have their own version and I'm not sure why they don't). 

All that to say is that I've noticed a difference in just the two weeks of using inositol (unfortunately lower dosage but now taking 8 pills 😭) and NAC with eating/sleeping and overall feeling well. However I am interested in taking more supplements to assist in overall health and to get off prescription meds and I'm looking for guidance. I'm aware of the following supplements and was wanting feedback on the following:

*I'm using Theralogix branded names as I was leaning towards using their products.

NeoQ10 - CoQ10
CurcuSorb - Curcumin
TherOmega Fish Oil

I am thinking of switching to their multivitamin as well and I was also thinking of taking their Vitamin D however if I do so I was going to do both to get the total Vit. D dosage to 4000IU as the mutil vitamin has Vit D of 2000IU and then one dosage of Vit D 2000IU.

I apologize for the long post as I'm an overthinker and I don't want to waste any more time and money with getting some supplements that I may not need. 

TIA! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1c26lzh/had_endo_ablation_and_question_supplements/,3,1712920807.0,/r/PCOS/comments/1c26lzh/had_endo_ablation_and_question_supplements/
Fasting Blood Sugar Frustration,"Hey everyone, first post here. I check my FBS regularly and it normally ranges in the 80's with the occasional low 90s. This past week it has been high 90s-101. I know that is not terrible but frankly, I have so much anxiety around it due to my mom telling me as a fat child that I would die of diabetes.

I exercise regularly (walk at least 30 minutes + strength train 3x a week) and typically follow a diet that is low GI and low carb (not keto - that is not for me but I do monitor my carbs because it helps my PCOS). I should mention that IF is not for me either. I have a diagnosed ED and am currently in recovery.

I am on metformin (1000mg, 500 2x a day), I take ovasitol (but admittedly was slacking for a few months and recently started religiously taking it again 2x a day. Before metformin and ovasitol my BS was ranging low to mid 90s, with just metformin it was mid 80s to low 90s), and take 1000mg berberine.

Currently I am on my period (yay - really yay, we all know how challenging it can be to get your period with PCOS) and have been sick.

My A1C was 5.5 (Spring/early summer), which was down from the previous time I had it tested (it was 5.7 last fall and my FBS when it was 5.7 was ""normal"" in the 90s).

Sorry if I sound dumb. I always had symptoms of PCOS externally (diagnosed at 13/14) and struggled with IR but my blood sugars were always very normal even when I was super overweight, until I was pregnant/had my child so I am still very much learning how to manage this portion, and honestly to manage my PCOS because lets face it - our resources were minimal in 2002 and still are. Thankful for this community.

Am I freakingout needlessly? I know worrying isn't good for myself, my PCOS or my insulin resistance and I am trying not to worry. I have scheduled a doctors appt but she can't see me until September so I am just hoping to hear ""don't worry"" or at least ""hey you aren't alone"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/15flfrz/fasting_blood_sugar_frustration/,3,1690916387.0,/r/PCOS/comments/15flfrz/fasting_blood_sugar_frustration/
Feels like my mom just brushes me off,"A little bit of back story first

I didn’t get my period until I was 16 years old. Late but not too abnormal. They were slightly irregular then but my mom kept saying that’s normal. But things started getting weird when I was 17 and it went away for 9 months. I was very worried and it was at this time that google led me to discover what PCOS was and I matched almost all the symptoms. When I expressed my concerns to my she kept saying either “It’ll come back,” “Stop worrying so much. That used to happen to me” “I have that to that does mean anything” or some combination of those. If memory servers, she even got a friend off her’s to tell me that it would come back. Well it did come back and was regular for a while so all is good right?

Flash forward to 2020, I’m in eating disorder recovery. Due in part to having to eat much more food, not being allowed to exercise, and basically being sedentary for 3 months because of quarantine, I put on 20lbs and my period went away again (I was already overweight when I started ED recovery). The doctor there suggested I go to the OBGYN and I learned that not having a period for that long isn’t normal. 

So eventually after months of my period still not coming back and my mom still telling me it’d come back, I searched for GYN by that point, I hadn’t had a period in 9 months. Long story short, my gyn said that while my female and male hormones are balanced, the male hormones are still way too high and from that point on, I’ve been on birth control and lost the weight I gained in recovery and then some.

Anyway

My mom has the same condition I do but I can hardly vent to her about it. She just brushes it off. For example, when I tell her I’m worried I’ll never have children (or in the very least, will have to go though hell and back just to have them), she just brushes my concerns off and says something along the lines off “Why are you so worried about that? Focus on other things” or “Well I had you so don’t worry” and best of all “I have a friend who has one ovary and she has kids so why are you so worried?” (To be fair, I am 21 but the fact that infertility is even list as a symptom worries me because I want to start a family some day) When I tell her I don’t feel feminine enough she says “Don’t be ridiculous.” My body hair “Some people just have that.”

I can’t talk to the one person closest to me about this because she just brushes it off constantly. So frustrating. I’m a little angry at her because had she taken me seriously when I was younger, I could’ve gotten diagnosed and treated sooner. It is what it is now but I’m just so frustrated.

EDIT: Sorry if this is too long of a read. I just wanted to get everything I felt was related to this out",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/udvfvc/feels_like_my_mom_just_brushes_me_off/,3,1651153774.0,/r/PCOS/comments/udvfvc/feels_like_my_mom_just_brushes_me_off/
In hope of getting a good grasp on all things PCOS,"Hello, I am in dire need of help and advice from y’all. To provide a brief background- I was diagnosed with PCOS at 17. I’m 22 now. My periods used to be regular at 18 when I used to actively go to gym everyday even though I was 20 kgs overweight at that time. My skin was better, I had no excess body hair, no facial hair, no fatigue, or scalp hair loss. Then I suffered an injury- a ligament tear on my ankle and the recovery took 6 months. By then, the stress of college had also increased and I never got back to working out actively again after that. For the next three years, I was put on increasing doses of metformin for my insulin resistance. For me, it made matters worse. My diet was all processed carbs, junk, sugar. My sleep schedule was out of whack. Stress all day, every day. No physical activity. I used to get terrible hunger pangs, I used to be ravenous despite eating ample food. I was also prescribed birth control pills - a 21 day course every 7 days or sumthin.. can’t remember exactly. They did result in bleeding.. but I didn’t take them regularly cause I wasn’t confident about being dependent on BC pills. Throughout the pandemic, i was pretty much depressed, anxious, and beyond caring. Things got worse than the worst. Entirety of 2021 I didn’t get my period. I piled on 20 more kgs - and as of Dec 2021- I reached my highest ever : 100 kgs (220 pounds) When I saw the scale reach a three digit on a kg measurement.. I was shocked out of my wits. I decided that I can’t keep going on like this. 

I consulted a dietitian at the beginning of December. She gave me a gluten free diet for the first week to address the bloating. Just about 1 and a half week into the diet - I got my first naturally occurring period. I was so happy. Then she took me off of the gluten free plan since she’s of the ideology that not any food group should be restricted. Cause once you lose weight, and then get back on a normal unplanned diet with that restricted food group included- you gain weight back rapidly. Idk what you guys think about that but I personally agree with her. So it’s been 10-11 weeks of consultation.  I have lost 11 kgs (24 pounds). I’m currently at 196 lbs. unfortunately, I didn’t get my period for January. I’m hoping I get it soon this month. I do yoga with light body weight based exercises. I also aim for 10,000 steps a day but I do achieve up to 8000. 

The way my diet plan goes.. it seems to be an IF following a 14-10 routine. There are salads, vegetables, fruits, eggs, cottage cheese (Indian paneer- very rich in protein), oat-bran based breads, fully skimmed milk, granola, dry fruits and a number of seeds (pumpkin, chia etc) incorporated in my diet. I’m a lacto-ovo vegetarian. Um, I’m not comfortable with chicken and other meat products.. I have no serious reason for it. I just don’t like the smell and chewy texture. This is just for me though, I’ve grown up that way. I don’t judge anyone. My own sibling and my dad are hard core non vegetarians, they enjoy pork, beef, lamb, sea food.. so yeah, it all boils down to a mere preference and comfort zone for me. I love eggs though. 

I’ve researched Keto and watched various videos by Jason fung, eric berg, ken berry.. regarding Keto, IF, OMAD, fasting. I’m comfortable fasting with liquid intake but only once every 2-3 days. But the rest of the stuff doesn’t seem to be a sustainable and feasible lifestyle choice for me. I cannot maintain ketosis, or deal with hunger pangs of 16-8, 20-4 IF routines. I’m bogged down with academic deadlines and I can’t afford to expend mental energy worrying about every meal. It’s just gonna add to stress and a cortisol response, getting in the way of my weight loss. 

My facial hair (mostly under chin and jaw) has gotten worse. I don’t know whether it’s worth it getting laser treatment done right now if my own bodily hormones are out of order. Every day I get out of shower and feel low and disappointed looking at the fine but dark hair on my breasts and stomach, and the thick happy trail from my belly button. I feel so under-confident. I have this blubbery abdominal area which I think is called a “hormonal belly”. My waist to hip ratio is beyond far from normal. Even though I’ve lost 20+ pounds , I can’t help but ruminate over the 60 pounds I still need to lose. In addition, I’m worried of what the heck is up with my hormones at the moment. I decided that I won’t go see a gynaecologist as they always just give me birth control, metformin and tell me to lose weight. I already know that and I already tried those medicines. I don’t want to be on birth control. I want to ovulate and have a natural frickin menstrual cycle. I don’t want an artificial inducement of just bleeding without ovulation. I want to get my progesterone in order. 

I’m just.. I feel hopeless and anxious. I ordered spearmint herbal tea the other day. I heard it helps lower androgens in women w pcos. 

I’d appreciate if anyone can weigh in with anything- a shared experience, a word of advice, motivation, links to useful resources, information, a doctor, diet suggestions, medicine suggestion.. anything. 

P.S. anyone from india or other south Asian nations here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/swa9ci/in_hope_of_getting_a_good_grasp_on_all_things_pcos/,2,1645277910.0,/r/PCOS/comments/swa9ci/in_hope_of_getting_a_good_grasp_on_all_things_pcos/
Navigating PCOS and ED Recovery,"hi, everyone!

TW: Talk of ED, weightloss

So, I was diagnosed with PCOS in December and I have been feeling generally lost since my diagnosis. I have dealt with a lot of conflicting emotions, mainly frustration that receiving a diagnosis has made me feel more confused, when I guess maybe I was expecting it to provide relief?   
I say this mainly because the only recommendations my doctor made to me were 20% weight loss and to start taking metformin; however, I am currently about 2 years into eating disorder recovery and intentional weight loss doesn't align with my goals in recovery, I'm just not willing to fall back into my eating disorder. My doctor also has not tested my A1C or confirmed in any way that I actually have insulin resistance, which judging by the consistent weight gain I have experienced, it is probable, but it just doesn't feel right to me that we have no numbers to back it up. After doing a lot of research, it seems that most people do not lose weight or have positive experiences taking metformin. 

I am currently taking inositol-as I have seen studies that show it is as effective as metformin-, vitamin D (mine was very low), magnesium, NAC, a daily probiotic, and multivitamin. If anyone knows of reliable supplement brands with a decent budget that would be appreciated as well-- PCOS isn't cheap!

 I recently started working with a dietician (RD) that specializes in PCOS and eating disorders, so I am hoping she will be able to provide me with more guidance, but I've been feeling really stressed about everything and would really appreciate hearing from anyone that is also trying to navigate a PCOS diagnosis while in recovery. 

I would also love to know your supplement stack, experiences with metformin/inositol, or really any advice anyone has to offer have that has been helpful for them! TIA <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/192v3uv/navigating_pcos_and_ed_recovery/,3,1704847906.0,/r/PCOS/comments/192v3uv/navigating_pcos_and_ed_recovery/
Need to vent,"I’ve had such an emotional week. I went to my primary care doctor hoping to get some meds for my PCOS. In this visit I didn’t get much help and also had high blood pressure which I’ve never had before and was concerning. I’ve been trying the natural way for so long and I’m exhausted I wanted to see what my options were. I was really hoping she would prescribe Metformin since I have chin hair and am overweight. She wouldn’t prescribe anything to me and stated I need blood work for my hormones done and to go to an endocrinologist. Ok I get that and I do need new bloodwork since it’s been years but I was just frustrated.

Then she wouldn’t prescribe me Wellbutrin and said I’d need to go to a psychiatrist. I was hoping the Wellbutrin would be better for me because I’m on Cymbalta and feel like it doesn’t help much anymore and I’ve heard great things about Wellbutrin on this sub. Another thing to note is I’m trying to quit vaping and I know Wellbutrin is good for that. She did prescribe me Buspar for anxiety twice a day. Idk if I like it yet. I still had trouble falling asleep and racing thoughts. 

Fast forward to today I was feeling off and had the nurse at my work take my blood pressure (I’m a therapist at a substance abuse treatment center). My blood pressure was even higher. I threw away my vape and hoping this will make the numbers go down. 

I’m feeling low self esteem right now due to all this. I know my diet has been crap and I’m not moving as much as I should. I do daily walks multiple times a day with my dog though so I think it is mainly stress, diet and vaping causing my blood pressure to be high. I also deal with chronic pain which is why I’m on Cymbalta and it’s so exhausting dealing with pain and PCOS. Every time I do a workout (low intensity even) it triggers pain.  I want to be more active but I’m so tired. I want to eat better but my cravings are so bad. I’m also in recovery so food has been my comfort for years and now I feel like I can’t have that 😩

On top of my low mood tonight I’m dating someone new and told him I was having a rough night since we were texting. He went into full guy mode and was giving me advice on working out and how I should try fitness classes. He’s super into fitness which is great for him but he doesn’t know me well enough to be giving me advice. It ended up making me feel worse. It just all felt judgmental even if that wasn’t his intention. I got the vibe he wants a girl who is super fit and that’s just not me at the moment because of everything I have going on. He made a point to ask for a full body pic when we first started talking and I had full body pics on my Hinge. I even called him out for it and said something like “are you worried I’m fat” and he said “you said it.” It made me really sad because I want to find a man who loves me for who I am and not my physical appearance. 

Thanks for anyone who reads all of this. It was pretty cathartic to just type it all out. I have lots of supportive friends and a therapist myself but I know you all understand the struggle more ❤️❤️ ",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1cyk4ne/need_to_vent/,3,1716437945.0,/r/PCOS/comments/1cyk4ne/need_to_vent/

"Amenorrhea, Lean PCOS, Post-Pill Recovery – My Journey So Far (Not TTC Yet) 31f","Hi everyone. I’ve been lurking here for a long time and I’ve learned so much by reading posts. PCOS feels very isolating much of the time. I haven’t seen much content that is exactly similar to my experience, so I wanted to post my own journey in case it helps someone else feel less alone.

Background:
I’m 31 years old and stopped the birth control pill in January 2025 after being on it for about 12 years. I likely had undiagnosed PCOS since I was a teen — I never had very regular cycles before the pill, in fact, by college it had become just amenorrhea. I went a long time (probably around to 9-12 months) without a period in college, which led me to start the pill at around 19 years old. I had been taking it ever since, assuming nothing was really wrong. 

After stopping the pill the beginning of this year (January 2025), I went months with no natural bleed and was diagnosed with PCOS in April 2025 based on bloodwork (elevated testosterone and a 3:1 LH:FSH ratio). My only noticeable symptoms have been irregular (or absent) cycles and occasional chin/jawline acne. I had a 1 hour oral glucose tolerance test that came back normal (it was actually on the low end of normal so I might ask my doctor about hyperinsulinemia). I also had A1C and thyroid normal from a routine physical the previous year. That, combined with my height 5’5” and steady weight (fluctuating at ~133-140lbs with estimated 24% body fat) led my doctor to conclude I don’t have an insulin resistant PCOS type. I don’t have excessive body hair growth or excessive hair loss. DHEA-S and SHBG were normal as well. 

I’m not currently trying to conceive, but I want the option in the future, and want to maintain my health as best as possible.

What I’ve implemented so far:
* inositol, magnesium glycinate, zinc, a probiotic, and about to switch my multivitamin to a prenatal
* Provera (medroxyprogesterone) as needed to avoid going too long without a bleed
* Occasional CBD use at night for relaxation

Timeline/Milestones so far:
* Jan 2025: Last pill withdrawal bleed
* April 2025: Diagnosed via bloodwork after 4 months no menstruation (low-normal estradiol, high LH & testosterone)
* May 2025: Provera-induced bleed
* June 18, 2025: first unmedicated bleed began after spotting for a few days — likely anovulatory, but it still feels like a big deal!
* June 20, 2025: bloodwork (cycle day 3) total Testosterone still high, LH:FSH still 3:1, but estradiol and progesterone showed a little upward movement

What I’m trying to focus on:
* supporting my mental health and stress (journaling, mindfulness, and allowing grief around this process)
* Supporting my body to hopefully ovulate naturally
* Preparing to speak with my doctor at the end of July about potential next steps (like Letrozole?) if my cycles don’t improve by the 12 month mark

I’d love to hear from anyone else in a similar situation — especially those with “lean” PCOS, who are in post-pill recovery, or who are not actively TTC but trying to learn about their bodies and ovulate.

I’ll try to update or post again if I have any more milestones or knowledge that comes from labs/doctor visits. If you made it this far, thanks for being here and for reading. 💛",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1lipq58/amenorrhea_lean_pcos_postpill_recovery_my_journey/,3,1750706425.0,/r/PCOS/comments/1lipq58/amenorrhea_lean_pcos_postpill_recovery_my_journey/
How do you do it?,"I have struggled with PCOS for a while and live in a place where doctors do not recommend any treatment except ‘lose weight.’ Now, I struggle with sleep because I have really bad allergies and deviated septum (had a septoplasty last week, still recovering.) I am in a position where I have a cook, and I am going to work on having a proper sleep schedule gradually. However, every doctor has recommended diet and walking to me. I have tried HIIT, weight training in the past and while I got slimmer, the scale never changed and so I gave up as my sleep got worse.

Now that I’m in recovery, gradually doing better and eating better. How do I start working out? Does walking really help?",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1fya85c/how_do_you_do_it/,3,1728314419.0,/r/PCOS/comments/1fya85c/how_do_you_do_it/
Return of symptoms after quitting BC among many other things,"Hello everyone. I didn’t know which flair to add to this so my bad if this doesn’t quite fit. I just need advice on a bunch of different issues I’m currently experiencing. 

Bit of a back story: I was diagnosed with PCOS at age 16. I was prescribed a combination pill and was on it for 7 years. I had to quit due to suddenly developing perioral dermatitis in 2019. I suffered from it for 9+ months and eliminated lots of foods to combat the recurring breakouts/reduce inflammation, but nothing helped. As a last resort, I got off the pill last April and haven’t had a breakout since. I was asked to get my hormones tested on the second day of my second period off the pill, but due to financial troubles I had to postpone it to my next period, which never came.

After coming off the pill, I had two periods, both were super late, but I was happy to see I got my period back straight away. My gynecologist had warned me that it might seem like I am back on track immediately after quitting, but we shouldn’t get too excited as some people may experience irregularities later on. That is exactly what happened. My period is 49 days late as of now. I did get the tiniest amount of spotting (like a drop) when I was only 18 days late. It’s safe to say now that I’ve completely skipped my third period after coming off the pill. 

Ok. Now that I am done with that. My main issues are the gradual return of symptoms I had 7 years ago. Hormonal acne is back. Peach fuzz on my face is growing in slightly darker. My eyebrows need daily maintenance again and my body hair grows back faster too.

The thing is, before coming off of birth control, I’d changed my diet drastically to treat my symptoms, because even when I was on the pill, I’d still get hormonal acne.

The first two periods I’d had, I was still on a fairly low-carb, gluten free, dairy free, refined sugar free, alcohol and caffeine free diet. But then I started getting help for anorexia and orthorexia (thanks PCOS for dramatically changing the way I view food for the worse) and am now on a weight gain meal plan. I introduced gluten back into my diet as I wasn’t sure if it quitting was doing anything for me and as a result I eat more carbs now in addition to eating more in general.

Now my questions: Can I still get my hormones checked if I am not on my period? Could being on a caloric surplus/gaining weight be causing my symptoms? I am still underweight so I might just be having amenorrhea due to that. I am also scared that now that I am gaining, I won’t be able to stop or lose weight if I do end up gaining too much. I’ve been underweight all my life, so I don’t know whether being in a normal weight range is going to make my symptoms worse. Most people say gaining weight is the worse thing you can do for PCOS. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know which problem to focus on. I am deeply overwhelmed. I can’t go back to restricting/controlling my diet obsessively because then I’d be giving up on eating disorder recovery. But with my symptoms creeping back into my life, I don’t know if I’m making my PCOS worse. I just need advice in general. Or comments. Anything. Has anyone had a similar experience? Thank you for reading this far if you did, sorry for rambling so much. These thoughts have been consuming my life and I am truly at a point where I can’t even function properly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/jabkf5/return_of_symptoms_after_quitting_bc_among_many/,3,1602588795.0,/r/PCOS/comments/jabkf5/return_of_symptoms_after_quitting_bc_among_many/
How to battle hip weight,"TW on ED

I am 39 years old and was diagnosed with insulin resistant PCOS at age 13. I am a short pear and I am overweight (my scales were taken away for ED recovery, but based on clothing and measurements, I probably weigh around 235 atm). I've never been able to get under 215 lbs. 

I have been struggling my whole life with disordered eating, and have had a full on diagnosed eating disorder for the past 5 years.

In the past 2 years specifically, I have been on a binge/restrict weight rollercoaster. 6 months of gaining 40 lbs, and then 6 months of losing 40 lbs (two cycles of each). I'm on the last cycle of losing what I gained from ED recovery (no I am not fully recovered, though I have learned some better habits to inhibit extreme restriction in the long run) and each time this happens, it gets harder and harder to lose weight from my hips. 

My restrictive ED tends to mess up all of my hormones, especially insulin, cortisol, testosterone, estrogen, and T3/T4. I have been able to heal several hormones after my last relapse and get back to losing what I gained during recovery. I quit IF and now I eat three meals a day and avoid snacks to ensure my insulin remains stable. I have also gone from strict keto to a hormone balanced keto (slightly higher net carbs through more non-starchy vegetables). I have lost a ton from my waist, abdomen, thighs, and arms. My stupid hips are slowly going away but not as fast as in the past. Those are the target of my body dysmorphia so I fixate on them- but they just need to go, and I cant make it happen. 

I go for power walks three days a week, each session between 3 and 4 miles at about 4mph, and one day of cycling for 40 miles at 12/13 mph. So I get a good 8-9 hours of cardio/resistance/HIIT per week (I integrate all three exercise types into the power walking and riding by adding in steep hills, rough terrain, sprint cycling, and jogging intervals during walking). 

Is it possible to target hip fat, or is that just something that will come off when it wants to come off? Im sure estrogen dominance does not help, though I am on progesterone replacement therapy. I have a classic pear shape with my hips being 10 inches larger than my waist. It's quite frustrating and I feel so self conscious and misshapen.

Update after my BSO Hysterectomy,"So many in here will remember I've been on a bit of a journey.   Last update I posted was that I would be having my surgery November 18th.   The surgery happened as scheduled and it went really well.  They were actually able to do it robotic assisted which is, from what I'm told, the best option.   They removed everything but decided against the lymph nodes as they felt there wasn't a true need to remove them based on what they saw.  

They did end up finding Grade 1 Stage 1 Endometrial Cancer and a 2 inch tumor.  They said it was within the lining and hadn't gotten into the uterine wall yet.  It's crazy though because I had that D&C in August and nothing was seen, though I am going to ask my OB/GYN if that would have even been possible for her to have seen.  They did also find my left ovary had the cysts, from PCOS, on it but also a spot that they said could have been endometriosis or something else.  They weren't 100% sure on that.   But they said they got everything out.  They aren't requiring any treatment, just have go in for testing every 6 months for the next 5 years.   

Recovery wise I've been doing great. I only stayed overnight in the hospital and that was more because as I was waking up from anesthesia I would doze back off and my oxygen went low so they had me on some but by like 6-7pm they took it off of me.  I can't say enough for the nurses at Karmanos. They were amazing.   They were attentive and kind.  And the food was so good!  Normally you hear horror stories about hospital food but no lie it was really good.  I'm still on restrictions until my follow up on Jan 9th where they'll check to make sure everything is all closed up from where they removed the cervix.  Then I will hopefully be able to take a bath again.  

PCOS wise the only thing I've really noticed is that the facial hair seems to not be growing as fast.  I know it'll take time for things to calm down. I go to my endocrinologist in April and I'm hoping to do some hormone testing to see if I can get things more evened out, if possible.  Other than that just trying to deal with the mental aspect of things and the factor of being called a cancer survivor.  Some days I'm fine, other days I can't even watch cute videos with babies in them.   Today a client, who got everything mixed up and thought I was having a baby and not surgery, asked if I had the baby and I didn't think it would hurt me that much but I ended up having a breakdown after getting off the phone with him.   But I know each day will get easier and I am beyond thankful that it was found and it's all gone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/zr2gay/update_after_my_bso_hysterectomy/,3,1671577000.0,/r/PCOS/comments/zr2gay/update_after_my_bso_hysterectomy/
How do you do it? How do you learn to love yourself?,"I don’t know if this violates rule 4, and I went so far as to make a new account because I’m so scared of myself and in denial but here we go. Also I hope mental health is the right flair. 

Wall of text on mobile, but then again no one is probably going to read it, but it’s nice to journal into the void a bit. 

This is a question I’ve been struggling with for a very long time. I guess you could say I’m new to a semi-pcos diagnosis, but it’s not my first rodeo with women’s health problems. 

I’ll set the scene, I’m a 23F who’s got a medical history so long and complicated it looks like the case notes they give Med students for tests. I think the only body system I don’t have something wrong with me is neurology. 

From a gynaecology point of view, I got my period when I was 12, I bleed heavily, irregular, horrific pain, family history of endometriosis, so we were on the oral BC wagon pretty quickly. I’ve been on back to back for probably 10 years. I had an IUD put in when I was 16 because I was part of the international program in school and would be traveling, and honestly it was a godsend to not have to take another medication. 

I had to have it replaced early (1.5 years ish) because I started to get bleeds even on oral BC. It was okay, where I lived at the time respected that it would be better to have it done under GA as it would cause less backlash from my body and a quicker recovery. Got a bacterial blood infection from the hospital, but aside from that it was a smooth change over. This time we decided to keep me on Oral BC as a precaution. 

Fast forward a few years, and things start getting weird. I’d like to say I was one of the very lucky few who didn’t get side effects from BC. No weight gain, no mood changes, nothing. I really lucked out. I was given a psychiatric medication incorrectly (malpractice) and gained weight rapidly, stopped the medication. It settled and while I didn’t lose the weight and accepted I would have to work for it, it had settled. 

Go forward a few months and slowly but surely I was gaining weight. To date over 18 months, I’ve gained 20kg (on top of the additional gain from the meds) with no explanation, and it’s continues now. I’ve had no changes in medication, I’ve had minimal lifestyle changes (any changes that have occurred happened after it was noticed), and I’ve been stuck with in a holding pattern with specialists. 

My gynae is an absolute gem (he was the one who brought me into this world and is surprisingly still practicing) and he has done everything in his power to make sure I’m at least comfortable with pain management, and regular scans to check for cysts (I had one removed in the past). I tried endocrine since the tests were lining up with Cushings disease, but was dismissed by the doctor and given the suggestion to drop all of my medications and treatment to see if it improved my weight. Gynae and psych both scoffed at the suggestion and sent her on her way. 

I started getting male pattern hair growth. By PCOS standards it was minimal, but it was definitely a noticeable change to me (fair skinned with blonde hair to looking like I had men’s leg hair and a mo). The body shape I was taking to was clinically normal for Cushings/pcos. The massive pack across my stomach, tuck shop arms. I’m covered in constantly newly forming stretch marks. 

I was getting to the end of my rope because although I had a good support from my gynae and my psychiatrist, things weren’t changing, my GP was dismissive (and still is) and I’m struggling. I overstepped one session and suggested looking at my hormone balances, to which gynae agreed. 

Tests came back. I have no FSH, no sign of premenopause, but elevated Testosterone. At the same time I had a scan showing I had small cysts forming, but without FSH. 

Finally, an answer. Probable PCOS, but basically dormant due to how well I’ve had my BC managed throughout my life, and probably dormant endo as well. They’re probably there but they’ve never had a chance to form. The raised T is probably the only symptom showing through, which in turn has messed with my weight. The only way we could get a definitive diagnosis would be for me to be off BC for a long period of time, which in terms of my health is not possible and probably won’t be until I decide to have children. We started with some Spironolactone to see if there’s some fluid retention, to try and get the T under control and to help with the hair growth.  

So I have an answer, finally, but I still feel no better in myself. I never had a lot of self worth of self confidence to begin with, but it was never like this. I can’t deal with the sensation of my new rolls of fat rubbing together or moving, I end up having suicidal thoughts when having to buy new clothes. I stopped using my wardrobe because I can’t bring myself to throw out all the old clothes I still yearn to fit into and feel remotely confident in. I can’t look in the mirror without having irrational thoughts, it’s even gotten to the point where I don’t shower as often as I should or even would like to because I can’t stand to see myself. I’m lucky in the fact I have a supportive boyfriend, who despite me refusing, showers me with compliments and loves me for me, but I just can’t love myself. 

So my question is, how do I do it? I want to be able to accept myself and to try and feel pretty with what I have (hopefully temporary), but I just can’t, I have no sense of self, and I feel so disconnected from what I currently am and what I used to be. I don’t really have anyone else to talk to about it, and the few people in my social circle I want to reach out to I don’t know how to, because I don’t want to be rude or offensive to them. 

I just don’t know what to do, and it’s just a brick in the Jenga of my mental health that I need to fix fast, or the introduction of probable arthritis will probably rip me over. 

If you guys can offer advice, please help me. 

(Disclaimer at the end: I realise that I haven’t included much on my mental health. I am actively being monitored and treated for environmental depression and anxiety, and it is flaring. All the medication I’m on are 5+ year stints, and they’re all weight neutral, hence my psych telling people to “stay in their lane.” I practice mindfulness and some DBT activities, which basically renders therapy a bit pointless since I already practice the teachings)

I just hope that people might have similar stories, and that they might have advice on how they accepted PCOS into their lives.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/hjvowg/how_do_you_do_it_how_do_you_learn_to_love_yourself/,3,1593691135.0,/r/PCOS/comments/hjvowg/how_do_you_do_it_how_do_you_learn_to_love_yourself/

History of eating disorder and developed PCOS,I recently got diagnosed with PCOS after labs and ultrasound. I gained more weight as well which made me suspicious. The problem is my history. I have a long history of anorexia. I was never underweight but still lost a significant amount of weight and had to enter treatment several times. My most recent recovery attempt resulted in more weight gain than I expected and I gained even more after that. Then the PCOS symptoms started. I weigh more than I ever have (5’2” 175 lb). I try to eat relatively healthy and exercise is difficult because I work night shift and go to school full time. I had a couple weeks of undereating and punishing exercise. Basically I can’t seem to try to lose weight without falling into the ED trap again. I’m starting oral contraceptives soon and I’m scared I’ll just gain more. I just want to know if anyone has been through this. Rapid weight loss almost always triggers ED behaviors for me. It is not healthy. I’m not sure what to do because it seems that I can’t lose unless I starve myself. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1ll6j46/history_of_eating_disorder_and_developed_pcos/,3,1750959758.0,/r/PCOS/comments/1ll6j46/history_of_eating_disorder_and_developed_pcos/
Diet Help/Advice: How do you control anxious eating? And what swapouts have you found helpful in your diet?,"I (23yo f) was recently diagnosed with PCOS. My symptoms are cysts, elevated androgens, rapid weight gain and inability to lose it (despite exercising like a maniac), facial/chest hair, insomnia, severe anxiety and irregular/heavy periods. It's taken me 2 years to find a doctor that believed me and I am currently on metformin as I am unable to take birth control (I am at a high risk of blood clots and no doctor is willing to take the risk of me getting a stroke). I have found the metformin is helping enormously with my eating. I am currently only eating a third of what I normally would as I just don't get hungry anymore. However, I am really wanting to make some hard and fast diet changes to help speed up my weight loss/recovery from this shit, because quite frankly I should be 20kg lighter than I am! 

I am after advice. So far I figure the big no nos are starchy/processed foods: potatoes, white rice, pastries/cakes, pasta, bread, alcohol. My issue is willpower... I won't actively go out and buy those foods myself, but if they are put in front of me in a social setting I feel pressured to eat them. I suffer from anxiety very, very badly (I think as part of the PCOS) - to the degree that I feel people will attack me if they make eye contact - and was wondering if anyone else here did as well, if it was linked to their eating, and if they had anything helpful that they said/did to stop themselves from making bad eating choices?

Secondly, interested in people's opinions on teas to help with PCOS (seems like spearmint and green are the way to go?)? Dairy? And what about porridge? Do people have a go-to ""mylk"" alternative that they use, and why?

Also wondering what people replaced white rice with. I'm mad for Indian food/curries and rice has always been a staple of mine. Would love to hear people's alternatives.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/p6fhvc/diet_helpadvice_how_do_you_control_anxious_eating/,3,1629243827.0,/r/PCOS/comments/p6fhvc/diet_helpadvice_how_do_you_control_anxious_eating/
BIRTH CONTROL HELP!!! :(,"please read all! tw// ED

hello! i’m new to pcos reddit and this is my first post here!! i’m a 20 y/o who also suffers from pcos, but i do not currently have any cysts on my ovaries or have had any in the past. i have extra hair (especially on my face :/) and experienced rapid weight gain, horrible depression and anxiety, and heavy periods that would last for 2-4 weeks in the past. i was diagnosed back in 2017 when i gained 80 lbs in a year and weighed about 226. before i gained weight, i was anorexic and went from eating once a week for two months to suffering from binge eating. i originally attributed the weight gain to my EDs and they definitely played a role, but it was mostly from the PCOS i was told. i am still in recovery from my EDs. i’m mentioning this for later. 

recently i started dating my boyfriend and all i’ve wanted to do is jump his bones lol. however, the birth control pills i’m taking (Nikki brand) absolutely make me dry as a desert. now, before anyone jumps to any other conclusions - i already switched to a pill with a little less estrogen. i was horny as hell, but i couldn’t stop bleeding!!!! i attributed it to normal spotting when you switch pills, but my periods weren’t evening out after 3 months and i was back to 2 week periods. i’ve tried other brands before, but none of them would work consistently and switched almost every 6 months until i was prescribed nikki in december of 2018. 

i want to try another method! what i really want is a hormonal IUD. i’ve seen a lot of people on here talk about how the IUD can inflame your ovaries and make PCOS worse. i’ve seen people saying the shots make you gain weight or don’t really work. :/ since i am in recovery, my biggest goal overall is to NOT trigger my ED. i want to avoid gaining weight because i am at a healthy weight for my body now (155) finally after 4 years and do not want to fall into bad habits again because i see myself gaining, which i believe would also be bad for my bodily health outside of my EDs!! 

i’ve never gained weight on the birth control pills i took because it regulates my hormones and i was also prescribed 500mg of metformin (not one of the brands that has recently been recalled thankfully) which i’ve been taking since 2017.

please reply with your advice! i’m going to make a GYNO appointment, but i was hoping to hear from other people’s experiences! thank you!!!


tldr; should i be prepared for weight gain if i get an IUD? what is the best alternative to pills for PCOS? would you recommend anything else or that i stay on the pills and try another brand?",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/hct346/birth_control_help/,3,1592684564.0,/r/PCOS/comments/hct346/birth_control_help/
Have you been told you’re high risk for Type II Diabetes because you have a diabetic parent or grandparent?,"My weight inclusive doctor just informed me that if that parent or grandparent was exposed to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War/Resistance War against America your fate may not be set in stone and your assumed genetic predisposition to diabetes might not be a reality. 

Veterans in the US exposed to Agent Orange are now eligible for disability compensation. https://www.va.gov/disability/eligibility/hazardous-materials-exposure/agent-orange/

Why does this matter? Because when most healthcare providers see an elevated BMI and PCOS classification on our charts they are obligated by insurance companies (here in the US) to counsel us about weight loss and scare us about diabetes. Reminder: your PCP or your OBGYNs are not Endocrinologists or Registered Dietitians. 

My weight inclusive doctor has been doing the work with me. She’s analyzed every test result I’ve had for the last decade, at varying sizes between a US 4 and a US 20 and at various stages of my restrictive ED and recovery. She’s cross referenced them with current fasting and non-fasting blood tests and after my last visit, her patient summary stated “not diabetic, no signs of insulin resistance”. 

Y’all, my dad died at the age of 59 after losing toes, almost losing his legs, losing teeth, and ultimately experiencing kidney failure due to his advanced Agent Orange induced Type II Diabetes. If you’re like me and you’ve spent years of your life punishing yourself because you didn’t want to end up like a loved one who may have been in the same boat as my dad, I suggest you take this information to your doctor and ask them to look into it further. 

The VA has resources about the PACT Act that also detail other illnesses related to other places folks might have served on their website. For example, my sister has reoccurring skin cancer and thyroid issues related to her service in the Middle East.

Lean PCOS and EDs,"Hey folx,

Brief mention of an ED but no mention of habits :)

I have had irregular periods for most of my teens and early twenties, and went multiple years without a period from 18 - 23 due to struggling with anorexia, which I have had since I was 14. At the time I was also diagnosed with hypothalamic amenorrhea.

After lots of recovery work, I have finally gotten up to a healthy weight and have been menstruating again, but my periods are fairly irregular. After some abnormal bleeding and spotting in June I decided to finally see a doctor again and got blood work done, as well as an intravag ultrasound. Doctor found cysts! However, he said my hormone and A1C levels were normal.

I have read that hypothalamic amenorrhea can be commonly misdiagnosed as PCOS as they both present ovarian cysts and can cause menstrual irregularities. I am just really anxious because I have reached a good period of remission and I think that focusing on eating a proper ""PCOS diet"" will lead me to disordered eating habits again. So much of PCOS treatment is based in diet culture it feels like. Don't get me wrong, I eat healthily and am very active, but I do have treats occasionally and it took a long time for me to reach a point where I could eat ""fun foods"" without freaking out, especially added sugars.

High prolactin with a side of brain tumor…,"Hi there! New to the forum but long time member of this awful party. (You’re all great tho)

Background, I (29F, 5’3, 195lbs) was diagnosed in ‘18 with hypothyroidism and PCOS. I was given metformin (the absolute worst) and synthroid. At the time of diagnosis, I didn’t have any cysts. Before said diagnosis, I got my first period when I was 10 and have always had irregular cycles, usually they would last anywhere from 10-30 days heavy then I’d go months without another and there were multiple times growing up where my dad considered taking to the ER for the pain. I have tried every bc you can think of but currently have an IUD. In ‘19 tried having kids, didn’t workout and I’m sure y’all understand when I say the amount of energy I’ve wasted explaining to doctors and friends that I can’t lose weight. Aside from PCOS I have a plethora of things wrong with me. 

For the last decade I’ve been dealing with subpar health insurance, as far as competency and quality go, so my concerns have gone unheard for years. In ’20 I was having severe pain and they tested me for everything under the sun regarding lady pain lol they found one cyst on an ovary, refused to do anything, got a second opinion and that doctor removed it in February ‘21, finding a second one during surgery, both roughly 5cm. 

After two back to back surgeries in January and February of ‘21, I expected to lose weight, especially because the January surgery prevented me from really being able to eat. Instead over the next 6-7 months, my weight skyrocketed. I went in to surgery at 145lb and by June I was 190, reaching 210 in October and now back to ~195 with little to no change in diet or exercise. 

I got bloodwork done which they (normal doctor) said it was fine (they didn’t even test my hormones! And the other bloodwork wasn’t fine! 🤦🏼‍♀️). Decided to have my surgeon look me over, her bloodwork showed extremely high levels of testosterone and prolactin among other things. Did a brain MRI and found a mass 3cm on my pituitary gland. Can’t see the specialist until mid February to get any more information about it so I’m completely in the dark. 

So now, that I’ve rambled and told you more than probably needed lol anyone else have this tumor? If so what was your treatment? I’ve read probably everything google has to offer on the subject, so kinda looking for first hand. TIA 🙏🏻

Recently Recovered from Anorexia and now have PCOS?,"Hi everyone. I have been battling anorexia for the past ten years, and I have just this year finally gotten to a healthy weight. I feel great (I do have some chronic health issues but they have gotten so much better now) and I can do so many great things I couldn’t when I was younger.
Unfortunately for me, my pelvic pain doctor who sees me for Endometriosis now highly suspects that I have PCOS.

She believes my symptoms started many years ago (when I was underweight) but still asked me about weight and if I struggle to lose weight 😭. I’m honestly heart broken that I now have to think about this as I’ve never been so healthy and spent years in eating disorder recovery.

I explained my eating disorder past and how hard I worked to gain weight to be healthy and she apologised and removed the losing weight information on the PCOS information pages she gave me. She also said that losing weight isn’t something for me to worry about but now I can’t help but freak out.

I worked so so so hard to get to a healthy weight and I am feeling so healthy so it feels like a sick joke. Now I’m scared I’m gonna have every doctor I see telling me to lose weight even though it will make me so sick 😭. 

i don’t want any tips about dieting or weight loss so if you are thinking about commenting that please don’t. However if any of you have any kind words or tips if you have gone through the same thing that would mean so much to me. I’m feeling so alone about this right now.

Thyroid disguised under PCOS,"Since I got my period when I was 12, they were a bit irregular. They started off irregular but for 4-5 years things were fine till I was 15/16.

No matter what i did it was very difficult to lose weight. I got diagnosed with pcos was given the so called “hormonal pills” and life was going on.

During covid i started calorie tracking and lost weight only when i developed a legit eating disorder and couldn’t eat more than 1300. I did lose 10-13 kgs of weight just to put it back even more quickly.

My periods kind of got lost and i had no clue what to do, but i always continued gymming after my injury recovery even though i couldn’t lose much weight. Only recently i got the pcos panel tests again…my TSH and prolactin levels were a bit high and on consulting the doctor she told that i need to take thyroid medicines on low doses and continue living a healthy lifestyle along with starting a gluten free diet. She said the hormones have the chance to get regulated and reverse in 3-6 months and then we can start to taper the doses.

Ngl guys i can see the change in a month! the weighing scale that wasn’t even moving a bit is now showing alot of changes per week n it just feels so relieving. Two weeks after starting the meds i even got my periods back. So please keep getting tested every 6 months at the least or anytime you feel your body is shutting down.

Starting creatine with PCOS,"Hi everyone! I was wondering if anyone has taken creatine to help with their workouts/muscle mass? I know one of the best things for PCOS is weight training but I feel like my recovery is very slow. I am hesitant though because of the water weight attributed to it.

I contacted a doctor who removes them, even after learning that often, tiny pieces of the coils can be left behind and—being so tiny—are able to move to other parts of the body. When I spoke to the lady who scheduled me, she advised me that they don't remove the implants; they remove the fallopian tubes, entirely. I said I was fine with it, of course. No little bits of nickel floating around in my body, and I'm not using the tubes anyway. 

I'm hoping to have a laparoscopic surgery, rather than a large incision, both because of recovery time (I can't really afford a week off of work, let alone 2-3), and because I scar painfully (hypertrophic).

My consultation is this Friday. I'm going to take a list of my symptoms, those that seem to have stemmed from the coils alone, and those that are from PCOS, but worsened after the implants.

Creatine and Pcos,"What’s everyone’s experience with taking creatine with pcos? 

I go to the gym 3x a week and am really trying to make a lifestyle change to get my weight under control. Ive started taking creatine following a recommendation from my boyfriend as he knows I get brain fog and said this may help. I stupidly tried this and did the research after taking it (only once luckily). I’ve read that creatine can help with building muscle and better recovery, as well as helping with the brain fog that comes with pcos. BUT I’ve also read about water retention, general weight gain from taking it, worsening of acne etc as a result.

Recovering from Lacroscopic Surgery - Looking for easy and gentle exercises.,"I (22F)  had a lacroscopic surgery for ovarian torsion on 2/8/22 (about 2 weeks ago). Apart from constipation the recovery has been pretty easy. I'm glad the 12cm cyst was removed and now want to focus on my next steps and avoid the regrowth of any such cysts. 

If any of you could help me find some gentle pilates or any other easy exercises just to get started again. From there on I want to progressively start doing more intense strength training (like I used to before the surgery). 

Also to people who have had this surgery: How was the recovery? And did you face any problems in the long term? My doctor said my right ovary was pretty bad, had developed lot of gangrene, but she didn't remove it. I am worried about this. I just hope it's ok.

Does a full hysterectomy help with PCOS?,"I (21 FTM) was diagnosed with PCOS when I was around the age of 11. I have ever in my entire life (cross my heart) bled or had form of a period. ~~(Please don't say ""You're so lucky!"" it truly stresses me out ;\^\^)~~

I had my first internal ultrasound today and we found a large, 5 to 6 cm cyst on my right ovary (bigger than my uterus..) and several other smaller cysts on the left. My doctor recommended getting a full hysto since I'm transitioning but I don't know what to do and I'm terrified.

I plan to get a second opinion and see if another doctor recommends the same thing before I commit to anything but for people who have PCOS;

* What was your recovery experience?
* Did it help you to loose weight?
* General pros and cons?
* What were the menopause symptoms like?
* Is anyone else in their early 20s and having to deal with a similar thing?

I'm mostly worried about being under the age of 25 and being in menopause. I did take HRT for 3 years before I had to stop due to an adverse side effect of getting severe chronic UTIs and my doctor said that I would have to take Estrogen if I got a full hysto but that doesn't seem correct since I'm trans?

I went for a post-hysterectomy check up and walked out diagnosed with PCOS,"I (32F) had a hysterectomy & endometriosis excision in March with a specialist - shout out to Dr. Riley! 
I was approved for surgery due to wildly irregular cycles (28-60 days), pain throughout my cycle, and some ultrasounds that showed multiple small ovarian cysts that other gyne’s wrote off as ‘normal’. Prior to surgery, it was a solid guess that I had endo based on years of logged symptoms. 

Surgery went great! Turns out I had very little endo, but it was definitely there. I kept both ovaries since they looked good. Recovery has been tough, but worth it. Yesterday I had my 6-week post-op check up with the specialist. 

I mentioned that my hormones are on a rampage the last 5-6ish months and have gotten worse since surgery (insomnia & hot flashes are a biiiiitch). Most obviously, I’m really struggling with cystic acne along my jaw and neck despite a good skincare routine. 
She asked how I’ve treated acne in the past. The thing is, I had pretty clear skin as a teenager (on my face, at least - my shoulders were a different story). We confirmed that I was not on hormonal BC prior to surgery. 

At that point, she reviewed the PCOS diagnostic criteria and the basics of symptom management. Especially given my mother’s symptom history, I very likely have PCOS. Basically, I can be optimistic and *hope* that my hormones will regulate in the next few months…but I should make plans to see an endocrinologist and prepare for some lifestyle changes.

I’m glad to find this subreddit, but feeling defeated at the same time. Your girl over here already has migraines, endo, and strongly suspected fibro. I’m at my emotional limit for invisible syndromes and I’m too damn tired to start another new treatment plan right now.

PCOS & Eating Disorder Recovery,"Hi there, I've just been diagnosed (IE, an hour ago) with PCOS - I'm 21, I was tested when I was 16, but they said 'no it's not pcos you're just anorexic lol' and I was like 'huh okay' - since recovering from my eating disorder I have ballooned in weight (in like the last 3 years), which I'm not happy about, I'm now very overweight, but also I'm not imminently dying so yay!

My doctor suggested weight management services and immediately I was freaked out - I can't diet or lose weight healthily, I make myself ill with fasting/purging and everything whenever I try. I know I need to lose weight, but my doctor is really pushing me with all these weight-loss classes and I don't think I can sit there and listen about how fat I am. It's really scaring me and I don't know if I can cope with the weight loss. Immediately I find myself back to being 16 years old and restricting myself to a stupid amount of calories, only focused on the scale

I don't know if anyone has suffered/suffers from a restrictive/purging eating disorder, but I don't know how to go about with telling my doctor that it might be dangerous for me to lose weight if not supervised.

If anyone has any advice or thoughts on this, I'd be greatly appreciative, as I feel so so lost, and also scared of falling back into old habits.

Ovarian Torsion and Salpingo-Oophorectomy,"Hello!
I'm 22F, and I went to the ER for severe lower right stomach pain on Friday. A CT scan showed a 9.4 x 5.0 cm heterogeneous, multi-septated cystic and solid mass on my right ovary. I had to be transferred almost two hours away and had surgery, and they ended up removing my right ovary, which was honestly a huge shock. I do have PCOS but they also didn't find any signs of endometriosis, which I was half expecting, but they didn’t take biopsies. 

I'm still processing everything, but my biggest concern right now is my fertility. I know I still have my left ovary, but losing one at such a young age makes me really worried about my future options.

Because of this, l'm seriously considering freezing my eggs while I still have the chance.
Has anyone else been through this? How did you handle recovery? (I am also in the beginning of my last semester of college doing my student teacher, and need to get back ASAP) How did you handle fertility concerns after losing an ovary? If you've gone through the egg freezing process, what was your experience like? I'd really appreciate any advice or insight-l'm feeling pretty overwhelmed.

I’m also having a really difficult time coping with losing my ovary, and the stress of being in the middle of my final semester of college. I’m consumed by self pity and worry of this happening to the other one and losing my fertility entirely. I’m not ready for kids right now (only 22) but my biggest fear is never being able to. All I have ever wanted was to be a mom.

Mirena removal and weight gain,"Bit of a long story but I was diagnosed with Endometrial Hyperplasia with atypia (pre cancer) in 2023. I had the Mirena IUD inserted in August 2023. 
In 2024 I lost 50kgs in order to prevent cancer and to be able to have children. Weight was a big risk factor for the condition. I had also just undergone three back surgeries within 2 months and was told I needed to loose weight to help recovery and future back issues.

I had a surgery 4 weeks ago to have a biopsy done of my uterus, d and c, and also Mirena removal. Luckily the biopsy came back clear so thankfully now that it’s been two years under treatment, I am now able to try conceive.

Since removal of my IUD I have gained a lot of weight. Around 5kgs in just under a month with no change to diet or exercise level. To be honest maybe even more walking than normal. 

I was wondering, has anyone else experienced this post Mirena removal? You hear a lot about weight gain while having the Mirena but I haven’t heard much about it post removal. Since I lost weight I have remained very stable for the last 10 months, right up until 4 weeks ago. 

Feeling a bit lost. My gynae thought my PCOS may have calmed a lot due to weight loss.

Should i get insuline resitance tests done scince i am high risk for diabetes type 2 due to family history?Where do i even go to get that done?

Getting A PCOS Diagnosis,"TW for eating disorders:                                                  



I’m having an extremely difficult time at the moment because of this. I (19F) went to the endocrinologist today with my mother to see about a PCOS diagnosis. 




Some background: I had my first ovarian cyst rupture when I was about 12-13 and I’ve been on a combo birth control pill ever since with no breaks/sugar pills. I have been overweight almost my whole life and I developed an eating disorder because of this. My mother has a bad relationship with food and it was thrust upon me from a young age that being in a bigger body was something that was shameful, even though most of the women around me are about my size in my family. I’ve gone to nutritionists and never lose any weight with them. I do have insulin resistance, which my wonderful primary NP helped me confirm. I am currently 190 pounds.




So today, I had an appointment with endocrinology to try to get a PCOS diagnosis and see what I could do from there. It was a massive waste of my time. I have an appointment with a GYN that keeps getting pushed back because of her schedule, so I decided to try endocrine. Basically, he told me that there was nothing he could do and that I just needed to lose weight. I had shared that I had struggled with an eating disorder earlier in the appointment. To my mother and my embarrassment, I burst into tears. I had tried to lose weight for so long and no matter how little I ate and how much I exercised, the weight barely budged. 




I left the appointment feeling like I had gone back three steps in my ED recovery. My mother, no matter how many times I tell her otherwise, always thinks I was a binge eater because she is. The whole appointment was basically just me crying while they told me I needed to lose weight over and over again and that I should think of this as a good thing because, in my mothers words “you need to lose 50 pounds, it’s not like it’s 100”. The appointment was about an hour away and the whole time home it was just constant talk about her appointments with her nutritionist and what she thinks I need to do. I’ve told her so many times that calorie tracking is a gateway to relapsing for me. 




I just need advice on where to go from here. I have an appointment with my mom’s nutritionist coming up and a GYN appointment in September. I am just feeling so discouraged and the feeling of almost relapsing is so persistent in my head. Any advice for someone who’s discouraged after a not-so-helpful doctors appointment? Or even words of encouragement?




Also, please tell me if i’m overreacting. I know I need to lose weight but it was such an unhelpful experience in my opinion. He did order labs for cushings testing and hormone levels but it was basically “you’re already on the pill I can’t help you past that”",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/15fu3vt/getting_a_pcos_diagnosis/,2,1690937158.0,/r/PCOS/comments/15fu3vt/getting_a_pcos_diagnosis/
Waiting to see if cyst will rupture or go away?,"TLDR: have two cysts on right ovary. ER doc said to wait and see if it bursts or goes away. Is this good advice?


I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 15 (37 now). In that time, I’ve had a few cysts burst and it’s one of the most painful things I’ve ever experienced. 

Fast forward, I had a hysterectomy in November. My doc left my ovaries, but removed several cysts and tumors off of them. 

Since the surgery, I’ve been having constant pelvic pain, but chalked that up to typical recovery. 

The last few weeks, I’ve been having abdominal pain. My GI doc ruled out Crohns flare up or obstruction or anything viral/bacterial, so sent me to ER for a CT scan and ultrasound. 

Everything came back fine, except they found two hemorrhagic cysts on right ovary. One of them about 1.5 inches. 

Im not sure about the left ovary because apparently they couldn’t find it at all? 

Anyway. The ER DR told me that this was likely the cause of the pain I’ve been having, but to wait and see if it goes away or if it bursts. And if it bursts, to come in right away so they can manage the pain and make sure I don’t experience any internal bleeding. I asked about just taking care of them now so I don’t have to worry about going through all of that, but he brushed me off and told me surgery was more dangerous right now than waiting. He also said that these were likely new cysts since my hysterectomy and that they can grow pretty rapidly because they “are literally filling with blood as we speak.”

I put a call in to my OBGYN but haven’t heard back yet. 

This morning, I’m having lower right back pain in addition to the stomach pain that’s fairly uncomfortable. Im assuming it’s the cyst, but with all my numerous other issues, I can’t be 100% certain. 

Im wondering if the ER doc is correct in just taking pain meds and waiting it out? Or with this new pain today, would you consider it worth going back in? I’ve already done Tylenol/ibuprofen combo w little improvement. But I don’t want to spend another 10 hours in the ER for nothing again.

Hello everyone. This is my first post.,"
I was diagnosed with PCOS about 6 years ago. I’ve been dealing with all of the symptoms since my 20s. My mother had it bad along severe endometriosis. She also had an issue with her surgeon leaving part of her ovary in and ended up being positive for ovarian cancer. Luckily they got it out and cleared her margins so she was good.

I’m seeing a new GYN. I like her very much and she is very thorough. I had a large cyst burst on my left ovary last month. It had me bent over in pain. 

I’m 45 years old so we started to discuss removing my ovaries or getting a hysterectomy. When I first started spoke to her, it looked like we were leaning towards a partial. I had genetic testing done and did not have any markers. I also had an endometrial biopsy this week.

When I went in for the procedure, she said after thinking about it for a while, she was leaning towards a radical hysterectomy.  I was kind of taken back because I thought we were waiting on a few other things in order to go in that direction. My wife is a nurse and has a lot of questions as to why we would go with a radical one instead of just removing my ovaries. With no genetic markers, and if my biopsy comes back fine, we both are not clear as to why we go in that direction. My doctors only reasoning at this point is because of my mother’s history. I have no other symptoms except for PCOS issues. I’m having unexplained pain in my left flank where my cyst burst. The other concern is endometriosis, but she’s not going to be able to tell until she goes in there for any type of surgery.

Has anyone had a similar situation?  Going from just removing my ovaries to a major surgery is a lot to consider. I also still have school-age children and work full-time so the recovery a 4 to 6 weeks is a concern to me.

I appreciate your input .

Unexpectedly diagnosed with no symptoms whatsoever?,"Hey everyone, I hope you're all doing okay <3

I had a routine ultrasound yesterday and the guy doing it told me I have PCOS, along with one fibroid. I was really surprised, because I've literally never had a single symptom - no weight loss/gain that wasn't attributable to other causes, no hormonal mood swings, periods so average and regular you could put them in a textbook. I do have high testosterone, but that's because I'm FtM transgender and take T intentionally, but before I started I didn't have any signs of raised T levels either.

I'm really grateful not to have symptoms and am trying not to be internally melodramatic, but I also can't deny I'm quite weirded out by suddenly finding out there's something wrong I didn't know about. I'm really freaked out by the idea of developing symptoms in future, and as someone in recovery (...sort of) from an eating disorder, the potential for weight gain especially gives me a lot of anxiety.

PCOS symptoms but doctors not concerned,"I'm 23F. I had my first period when I was 13 but developed anorexia at the same time. I started recovery and got it back at 14 for about a month, then it never came back again since I was in a constant recovery/relapse cycle. I have very oily skin and as a teen I had ""normal"" teenage acne but it was well-controlled with a benzoyl peroxide face wash. I also have a strong family history of cystic acne (my dad, cousins, etc). I also have mild keratosis pilaris if that matters.

When I was 19 I started the mini-pill for protection. My gyno also stated in my chart that my lack of periods was most likely due to amenorrhea. Stayed on that for two years while still using a BP wash, hardly any acne. I went off the pill and developed very painful cystic acne concentrated on my cheeks/jaw area, but also some on my forehead — I had also switched to a non-BP face wash when this happened. I eventually started using the BP wash again and slowly my acne totally went away.

It was kept under control until the BP wash was discontinued. My acne came back but this time in the form of a lot of clogged pores and what looked like fungal acne. Skin was extremely oily and this is when I noticed I had dark hair on my upper link and some on my neck. Went to a different gyno (I had plucked/used a face razor on the hair) and told her everything — she put me on a different birth control. I also went to a dermatologist who said my acne looked hormonal.

Currently my acne is very well-managed with Epiduo Forte and Yaz birth control. I still get black, thick hairs on my upper lip and neck (not like a beard, I have like 6-8 neck hairs, maybe 6 lip hairs, and one random cheek hair...hard to tell) — but my mother says she had all of that too and she does not have PCOS as far as she knows. My skin and hair are very oily still. No natural period whenever I've taken breaks from the pill (I asked another gyno and she said it was most likely due to low BMI). I have no issue losing weight. I do have some insulin issues in the form of genetic reactive hypoglycemia — my mom and her mom have/had the same thing but doctors are not concerned.

**ANYWAY, so with all that being said,** I am confused as to why doctors don't think I could have PCOS. I mean, if I did have it, I'm already on the pill which should help. But I'm terrified if I ever have to go off of it that I would get more facial hair, the cystic acne would come back, etc. Is it really possible this is all ""normal"" and just due to my genetics and eating disorder history? I brought up possible PCOS to a gyno and she said if we tested hormones I'd have to go off the pill...I am so scared to do that so I said never mind. After I said that she reassured me that likely that was not an issue and staying on the pill was safest to reduce cancer risks associated with amenorrhea.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/13xd69e/pcos_symptoms_but_doctors_not_concerned/,2,1685612572.0,/r/PCOS/comments/13xd69e/pcos_symptoms_but_doctors_not_concerned/
My journey,"Well it al started when my mom met my dad and they had me… lol jk. 

I wanted to make things more light hearted. I moved from Mexico City to California about 9 yrs ago on June 2013. By January of 2014 my period was taking longer to come till by March it had been 2 months without it. I got scared and since it was a new place, country and language I didn’t say anything until my mom found that I hadn’t used any pads for my period and started asking me if I was pregnant (really?). 

She took me to the doctor along with my stepdad. I was told to just lose weight and it’ll get better. That was in May of 2014, I was graduating from 12th grade and going to community college and it was then when my hell began. By July of 2014 my period came back 28 days to the dot. It was normal more abundant than it used to and my December of 2014 I started with little pinchen on my back or my pelvis. Then my right or left side around the pelvis area and I thought it was normal even though I never had that kind of pain when I had my period before it went away.

Each time I brought the pain to my doctors they would send me to get an ultrasound and they told me I had nothing that it was just cramps till I changed doctors. The new doctor sent another ultrasound (4 in a span of a year) and by 2015 I was told I had a 1.2 cm cyst in my right ovary. The doctor took a good 1.5 hrs on top of my appointment to tell me after that just take Tylenol or ibuprofen one week prior to your period. THE FREAKING ISSUE WAS MY PERIOD WAS STILL IRREGULAR. I could go 28-33-30-40 days between periods and I thought that if every time that was going to happen I wasn’t going to waste my time and I stopped going to the doctor and sucking up the pain from 2015 till 2022.

In 2022 we changed insurance and we got a new doctor. Actually and NP who listened to our concerns and the first thing she did what a full physical exam. And she sent me to get an ultrasound (5 or 6 by then idk). That cyst other doctors wouldn’t act on and see what was going on was then 2.2 cm. When she told me that she referred me to and obgyn who at the moment I had my first appointment with him and told him all what had happened and what they told me to do for they pain he was angry. He even told me that if I had developed a tube twist that could had been way worst. 

Two months later I got a laparoscopic surgery to remove the cyst and ho surprise! It was not 1 or 2 but 5 cysts and 50 ml of adhesive tissue in my uterus. The recovery from the anesthesia was funny because I woke up humming Christmas carols in August lol. They pump you up with gas to see better and trying to get the air out is awful. I Can say that after that my NP sent me to get a full hormonal panel and saw my low iron (a bit of anemia) and my testosterone up. She sent me to the endocrinologist and I tell him again all my story. He nods and tells me you have PCOS. And I smiled and I tell him that I had been doing research and I was between PCOS or endometriosis. 

At this point am on medication for hirsutism and my insulin resistance. It’s hard because now I’m starting to get those pinces and back pain again and I think is my left ovary. I got a new ultrasound today and I’m waiting for the results to come back and my doctor to check with my and see what’s up. Also, at this point I’m getting ready to apply for medical school because this experience got me thinking about all the pain we go through and that there are not many doctors who actually listen and I’ll like to make a change and help others like us to get the right treatment for this illness.

"Advice/Insight Appreciated: Not Insulin Resistant, Now Maybe Off BC?","Hi all!

I was diagnosed with PCOS 15 years ago. At the time, I was lean and muscular with a very small amount of downy blonde hair down my abdomen and lower back so, physically, I didn't show any signs of PCOS (my endo used to show me to her students lol). Ultrasound showed the classic ""string of pearls"" around my ovaries and I had high testosterone. I'd also never had a period but, in retrospect, I was anorexic and eating less than 1,000 calories per day (back then I guess I didn't realize you could be a ""healthy"" weight and still have an ED). 

I was immediately put on a HUGE dose of metformin and a hormonal birth control pill. I was sick all the time from the metformin: dizzy and blacking out if I didn't eat constantly (needed a snack roughly every 2 hours), vomiting regularly, loose stool every fucking day, and I started gaining a ton of weight. It was pure misery.

Last year, my new gyn took me off the metformin because I've never had high blood sugar or A1C. I gain weight around my midsection but even half of a 750 metformin ER would send my blood sugar plummeting to the point where I couldn't drive to work because I'd black out. She had zero qualms about taking me off and I sure as heck didn't fight her.

I feel SO much better now that I am off of it! I am, however, worried that I may have fucked up how my body operates after being on 1550-2000mg of metformin for 15 years. Has anyone experienced this or heard anything about it? Am I just overly anxious (I mean, I do have GAD hahaha). I am considering getting my RMR tested.

In light of my recent realization that I was anorexic as a child and teenager, I'm also planning on going off the pill for a little while just to see if I can have a period now that I eat a normal range of calories. I'm also 34 so I'd kind of like to explore fertility testing and seeing if that is even an option for me at some point. And part of me is concerned about what sort of lasting effects I may have just by nature of having been on the pill consistently from the ages of 19 to 34.

I'm also really hoping that maybe, just maybe, it will help with some weight loss. I feel like I have tried everything and I just can't stop being 100 lbs heavier than I was when I was diagnosed. It's so frustrating! I eat a mostly vegetarian diet, I keep my calories in a healthy range, I try not to eat junk food (but I'm also in ED recovery, so if I eat cookies, so be it. Sometimes I just need the dopamine in a Famous Amos cookie lol). I exercise (cardio, yoga, weights). Labwork from my annual physical is always good. BP is good. I have ADHD and Hashimoto's which complicates things but, holy mackerel am I ready to be 150 - 175 again (I'm 5'9"")! (Edit: I also didn't experience any hair loss on my head until after I started PCOS treatment. I used to have such lovely thick hair!) 

Has anyone else seen weight loss benefits after coming off of the pill? Anyone else been on metformin despite not being IR and what did you experience going off of it?

Honestly, sometimes, I feel like such a PCOS weirdo I wonder if I was misdiagnosed. It'd be great to connect with people in a similar boat. And it's always nice to connect with people who know more than me (bring on the scientific papers!)",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/o9qle6/adviceinsight_appreciated_not_insulin_resistant/,2,1624905844.0,/r/PCOS/comments/o9qle6/adviceinsight_appreciated_not_insulin_resistant/
"I am pissed, heartbroken, lost... ugh.","Hey guys, long time no rant. I don’t even know if I’m in the right place. Lemme splain.

My first Gyno, in 2016, said I probably had PCOS and I was like “oh damns I does” after reading posts here, doing my own research, listening to that Curbsiders podcast episode someone posted a while back, etc. I felt like having a diagnosis and having you guys meant I not only had a path to recovery, but a community to rant, research and belong with. 

Welp, enter I, the apparent medical f’ing miracle my friends!

When Gyno number one refused to do anything about me bleeding half to death (I’m the 57 hgb girl who had to have an emergency transfusion in July, holla), I begged my gp to find me a new Gyno. Thank you pandemic for limiting my options and assuring almost all the Gynos in my city (of 600,000 might I add) refused the referral. 

Now I was so happy when Gyno 2 was all business. Gotta get that bleeding fixed. Okay. Try oral bc. Okay but, it didn’t work before. Let’s try a new one. Okay. Puts me on Lolo. 

Now I was open to doing whatever he said cause at least something was better than nothing. So I waited the three months, probably passed a dicidual cast, fainted more times than I’d like to admit, vomited more than a cat with a permanent hair ball, bled like a stuck pig, had to have two delicious bags of blood AND four delicious bags of Venofer (iron). Then came last week.

Gyno 2 and I had a phone consult. 

We had talked hysterectomy previously and I was elated when he said “yeah, you can’t live like this. We need to get your levels up but then yeah.”

MOTHERF’ER DECIDED NOW THAT MY LEVELS ARE UP AND “THE BC HAS STOPPED THE BLEEDING” HE “WONT TOUCH ME”

So I asked if that meant I had to be on BC for the rest of my life. He said well no, not the REST of it. But guys, if I take my BC even like ten minutes late I’m in pain and I spot heavily. Yes I told him this and he told me that it was normal and I don’t qualify for a hysterectomy... according to him: “You’ve had to have one of three issues and one is super heavy bleeding which you’ve had. So no you aren’t a candidate for one and I won’t touch you.” WHAT? How does that makes any sense?!?

Finally I said “okay... well... at least tell me... in your professional opinion... do I have PCOS?”

According to him my bloodwork shows indicators, my ultrasounds are inconclusive (I’ve had so f’ing many) and I only have one dermoid cyst on one ovary. No fibroids that he can see. He says my physical exam (he never touched me and I doubt looked at me, def didn’t ask any questions) says to him that I don’t. So he would conclude that I don’t.

What..? Okay so explain the PCOS belly. Explain the hair loss. Explain the heavy bleeding. Explain the beard and moustache that makes my husband jealous. Explain the cystic acne. Explain hair in places I SHOULDN’T HAVE HAIR. 

Im terrified to sleep with my husband (which was kind of the pushing force behind getting a treatment) because when we do anything, it’s f’ing painful and I bleed like a mofo for days. Seeing as “your next period could kill you” I’m not even going to attempt anything with my man. We’ve been married almost ten years and have had intercourse like... 10 time’s tops. No exaggeration. I even bled for a month before and after our wedding sooooo no wedding night. 

I feel like Gyno two basically told me there’s nothing wrong with me. He isn’t even doing any more tests. He won’t see me for six months and that’s only for the dermoid. I want a diagnosis. I want an answer. I want to be able to have a relationship with my husband for f’s sake!

Vitamins/Supplements,"Hi! I got diagnosed this past friday and I am looking for some vitamin guidance.


I have folicles on both ovaries and I've been experiencing pretty rapid weight gain while off birth control the last 8 months. I now have an IUD but was wondering what vitamins people take for different PCOS symptoms?


I don't want anything specifically for fertility as I never really wanted to give birth, so at this time it is not a huge concern for me. As far as insulin resistance, hair loss, acne, weight what vitamins do you guys use??

"recently diagnosed, need advice","Hi, I'm usually a lurker but after some thought Iv decided to post here, I'm looking for some advice and don't really know where to start. I'm 17 years old and was just recently diagnosed with Pcos. It was a shock to me as I don't really exhibit many of the symptoms except that I've only had 3 periods since I was 13, and I guess my body hair grows a lot faster and darker in comparison to my friends but it's never been a problem, same with weight gain. 

Anyway my gp put me on birth control (rigevidon) as she explained its important that I have a regular cycle and I'm a but unsure of her exact wording for this but she also says something along the lines of regular menstruating being helpful in preventing or removing cysts I have as they could potentially turn cancerous if left. This part is what confuses me. I'm unaware of exactly how many cysts I have but they have never once caused me any pain or discomfort, unless the extreme back pain I experienced during 2 out of my 3 periods that left me unable to walk are related to them somehow? I'm relatively clueless on this subject so sorry if I sound ridiculous, haha. 

It's been a week since I've been on birth control, and already I can tell its having a significant impact on my mood. In the past I dealt with mental health problems however this year I had finally been making great progress in recovery and have felt happy and content with living for days and weeks on end. I can't describe how amazing a general sense of well-being feels after years of living in a depressive fog!! The past few days, however, iv been overly emotional, bursting into tears, feeling extremely irritated over small things and I even had a panic attack for the first time since 2015 last night. The pit in my chest is exactly like the constant overarching feeling I lived with for years and the thought of having to deal with it all over again is heartbreaking honestly, I feel like all my progress will be for nothing. Iv read that birth control can worsen underlying mental health issues and I just don't want to deal with it.

Would it be unsafe for me to stop taking the pill for this reason? Or should I continue to because of Pcos? I was quite fine with never having to deal with a period monthly(lmao who wouldn't be)and as I says I haven't had to deal with any pcos symptoms that the pill could help with. My mum deals with similar mood and hormonal problems so I really should of seen this coming. I'm trying to keep a positive outlook but knowing my mood problems are happening because of something out of my control isnt helping :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/6r92cl/recently_diagnosed_need_advice/,2,1501724457.0,/r/PCOS/comments/6r92cl/recently_diagnosed_need_advice/
Breast Reduction,"Has anyone ever gotten a breast reduction and it looked weird if you have PCOS belly? I'm 5'9, weight about 220 LBS and wear a 40G bra size. I'm considering a breast reduction in the summer but the surgeon told me I had to lose some weight or my recovery won't go well. He said he can do the surgery but to try and lose the weight or he can also do a tummy tuck. I don't have kids and don't plan on having kids. I wear a size 16/18 and I don't think I'm that big because of my height.

I guess it upset me that he told me to consider a tummy tuck since I don't think I really need one.   
My questions are, if you did get a reduction did you belly stick out too much and look weird? Did you get a reduction and gain it back? Was you recovery difficult? 

If you have any advice on weight lose that would be great too!

Endometrial ablation? Also PMDD,"I'm only 27. 28 in a couple weeks. Not officially PCOS but I have many of the symptoms and my hormones are very close to being diagnosed with PCOS. They said it could be early.

I have never had regular periods. I had one in December because I took Progestin to trigger one. Before that my last natural period was 6 months before it. I haven't had a period since Christmas because, well, the protestin went awful. Turns out I have PCOS which is why getting an IUD was a nightmare that got me hospitalized for being a danger to myself.

I am terrified of taking the progestin again to trigger a period. I was depressed, anxious, and suicidal. I'm also diagnosed bipolar and typically pretty well medicated, but when the hormones start changing I go crazy. I want to self harm and kill myself. My anxiety is extreme. The depression is debilitating.

Hormones are not the option for me. Given the bipolar I'm leaning towards not having kids because I'm terrified I wouldn't survive the pregnancy due to the hormone shifts.

I have to have periods regularly, otherwise I may get endometrial cancer. 3 doctors told me that.

Can't get endometrial cancer if I don't have an endometrial lining.

Thoughts? I see my OBGYN next week and want to know if I should fight for this.

If it sounds like the right procedure for me, what is the procedure like? What is the recovery time? Is it possible to have kids after ablation? I've heard yes and I've heard no.

"Cinnamon tea/supplementing, or other herbal paths for insuline resistance/bloat/etc? *ED mention warning*","Hi everyone! Just another 21 y/o looking for some suggestions on supplementing/ teas for some PCOS symptoms. Currently I struggle the most with insulin resistance, weight gain, bloating, and anxiety. As of a few months ago I am in remission from a long time ED problem, and have put on significant weight in the recovery process. I'm not super stoked about it, but I'm looking to fight back in the most positive way. In July I was put on 500mg metformin daily. As of recent I am trying to scale up my exercising to a consistent regularity, and for a uni student I'm proud of the amount of junk I cut out of my diet. However, I'm still having some struggles with insulin resistance that is causing me to continue to gain weight, as well as previously mentioned bloating and severe anxiety problems. 
I was glancing around online at the use of teas, specifically ones like cinnamon or just cinnamon supplements even, for insulin regulation and bloating. Is there anyone here comfortable with sharing their thoughts or experiences with using cinnamon as an herbal alternative? Would it be risky to supplement cinnamon or drink cinnamon tea regularly with 500mg daily metformin still going? Are there any other teas or supplements or such that help with bloating/insulin resistance/anxiety and dont cause complications that I should know about?

PCOS post menopause- what to expect?,"Hello! Asking this for my mom, who only figured out that she's lived with lean PCOS for most of her life last year after I told her some things I learned in this subreddit.

She's post-menopause, and doesn't have acne issues or body hair problems. She isn't struggling with her weight, though she does have the PCOS gut at times (although she's been gluten free for a long time and typically a vegetarian, so her diet doesn't need a full overhaul- BUT she does love sugar).

As of the last few months, she's been under a lot of stress, not sleeping enough, and has been eating a lot of junk food just simply because it's comfort food and she can eat it quickly. She does suffer from PCOS fatigue and has for a long time, as well as the brain fog.

As of the last month, her hairline is receding. Badly. Which has never been an issue for her before (though her hair fell out in clumps when she was in menopause). And frankly I don't know if she's at risk for any cancers or any other medical conditions since she's post having a period.

I am doing research on how to reverse symptoms naturally and also heal my gut health. This is what I came up with so far for supplements and actions:

Supplements to take:- Probiotic (gut health)- Vitamin E (blood and brain)- Myo inositol (improves pcos symptoms)- L-Glutamine (bloating, gut health, muscle recovery)- Magnesium (bone health and stress)- B-Complex (energy)- Ashwaghanda (stress and anxiety relief, insomnia)- Multivitamin- Fish Oil (hormone health + omega 3)- Co q 10 (PCOS and inflammation)Things to do:- limit dairy and gluten- Walnuts for hormone health- Cinnamon- Apple cider vinegar- Walk more- Weight training- Spearmint tea

I want to start this supplement journey because I also have bad inflammation in my belly and am struggling to lose weight. I want to feel my best.

Recovering from ovary torsion,"I was diagnosed with PCOS at 13. Had scans, told my cysts were larger than most but birth control would help them shrink and manage them. I’m now 21, I spent 6 years on birth control and hated every single moment. Lost myself, relationships, and everything in between. After getting off of birth control, I went to many different gynos trying to find an alternate approach that didn’t make me a raging bitch. No additional scans ordered, no one ever listened, took me seriously. It was always blamed on my weight gain. Being told I was fat and should lose a few pounds and maybe they’d go away. (I’m a very athletic and healthy person, who struggles to lose the weight I gained while on BC, due to my PCOS, I’ve literally tried everything) I lived with it. I had no other choice. Last weekend I was rushed to the ER for excruciating lower abdominal pain presumed to be appendicitis. Nope. Turns out I had a 24cm cyst on my right ovary and my ovary had torsioned. At 21 I lost my right ovary due to negligence of multiple doctors over the years. It took 8 years to get another scan, and only because I ended up getting a CT scan for appendicitis. This is crazy to me. Anyways, I had a great surgeon, and a great team of physicians, however the recovery guidelines were lackluster. To anyone else who has lost a single ovary, how was recovery for you, any change in fertility, sex drive, how long were you out? I’m hoping to find someone who has a similar experience or atleast understands what I’m facing.

Only Clinically Diagnosed,"Hi all! The title says it all. I was diagnosed based on that 3 set criteria they talk about and that was it. I basically explained my symptom history to my gynecologist and then she told me she could give me a clinical diagnosis. Now, my question is if I was only off my hormonal IUD for 2 months and just went back on (had 2 periods in between but they were heavy and brutal AF) & she tested my testosterone levels right after I got the hormonal IUD put back in would my free testosterone level reading even be accurate does anyone know? She did refer me to go see a new endocrinologist bc I am in ED recovery and my old endo was a man who was all about weight loss only (to my understanding of him, since I know 2 other ppl who have seen him including my own dad) & I just would rather see a woman who can be sensitive of my eating history and see the whole scope of my health beyond just weight loss. So I am seeing the new female endocrinologist in late April which is great, but I just wanted to know what you guys know about the free testosterone test and whether a hormonal IUD having been in my system recently would have impacted it? I was on hormonal IUDs for a longgggg time btw before that discontinuation which lasted a little under 2 months. She decided to test me this week bc it was the longest I’d been off hormonal IUDs since I was like 21 and I’m 31 now 😱 I don’t feel like getting into the reasons I went off rn but yeah! I guess we wanted to see my baseline but I’m not sure that test would even be accurate after such a short period of time w/o artificial hormones. Plz don’t just tell me to Google it. I am new to this process and my clinical diagnosis even tho I’ve had symptoms since puberty and do plan on talking to both my providers but I can’t help but be curious abt the testosterone thing bc I just received my levels back on a Saturday which were well within normal range btw!

YOU WILL LEARN

* Why your self-destructive behaviors around food are not your fault
* How specific foods are engineered to hijack your brain chemistry
* The role of hormones and neurotransmitters in creating and perpetuating cravings and urges around food
* How “wanting,” “knowing,” and “doing” are controlled in the brain and how to make this work to your benefit
* The differences between food addiction and various eating disorders and why this matters for diagnosis and treatment
* The different stages of food addiction and which treatment approaches are best for each
* The critical importance of social support in recovery from food addiction – why treatment must go beyond just the food
* How to create a recovery plan that’s realistic, enjoyable, and sustainable, so you can achieve food freedom and reclaim your life
* There is hope: no matter how far gone you feel, no matter how alone or out of control; you can recover from sugar and food addiction

YOU WILL FINALLY HAVE ANSWERS FOR WHY…

* Willpower is not needed to break food addictions – and what does work
* So many diets failed you in the past, despite your strongest efforts
* You self-sabotage with food even though you feel desperate to lose weight or improve your health
* Weight loss surgery and medications are not permanent solutions for binge eating or food addiction

Best to everyone struggling with these issues, it is not easy! Grappling with this has really helped my IR, PCOS and my hair grew back to my surprise. The fear of IR leading to diabetes (more insulin > going bald again) or Alzheimer's (I had wicked brain fog even when thin) keep me motivated. Westman's book gave me a roadmap out of the bad place I was in, and Food Junkies made me feel not alone in how I got there to start with. 

It is also super common for people to swap one addiction for another so info and insight is important, in the book she describes how alcoholics often become sugar addicts and bulimics often become alcoholics. Ugh. But, it's possible to become free from using food or other substances in an unhealthy way. The book Dopamine Nation also fit well with their approach, I thought. I needed to find ways to get serotonin and dopamine w/o putting things in my mouth. That process has really deepened my relationships and enriched my life through hobbies and other practices in a  way that cookies or Doritos never could. My health has also improved in so many ways, no more skin tags, GERD, HS flairs, moodiness, super heavy painful cycles, chronic sinus infections, tendonitis, migraines, reactive hypos that felt like panic attacks, etc. and my hair growing stopped the daily crying in the shower. I did have slips along the way and tried to learn from them and start over, it is not easy. If anyone else is in that place, I wanted to pass along this info and the book titles in case it might help. You are not alone! r/sugarfree is a great sub, too. Lots of supportive folks there. The book Hooked is quite eye opening too, processed food is literally engineered to get us addicted. Whether we are plant based, SAD, keto, etc, unless we are super mindful, the % of diet that is processed is increasing rapidly. 

Best to all on your health journey!",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/u48c9z/for_anyone_struggling_with_addiction_to_sugar/,2,1650030101.0,/r/PCOS/comments/u48c9z/for_anyone_struggling_with_addiction_to_sugar/
Possible surgery needed for cyst - eep!!!,"Hi everyone, 

I hope you're all having a great day! It's actually SUNNY here in Scotland, which is nothing short of a miracle, I tell you :) 

I've been seeing a fertility doctor after I got diagnosed with PCOS, and during my first appointment (Dec 2017), I got an internal ultrasound. This showed that I have a much larger than average cyst on one of my ovaries, and it's causing problems. My doc recommended I lose weight (before we could try fertility drugs), and I've been working super hard to lose as much weight as healthily as possible. It seems to be working, because I've lost 22lbs since January - yay!!! 

I went back to my doc yesterday, and she was pleased. She was less pleased, however, with my cyst. I had an MRI a few weeks ago, and it showed that the cyst is still very large and hasn't appeared to have shrunk. So now the option would seem to be surgery. I've to have another scan in 6 weeks, and if it hasn't at least shrunk a little, then it's surgery time for me. 

I'm honestly crapping myself over the thought of surgery - I've never had an operation before!! And I hate the thought that there's nothing I can do but wait and hope that the cyst goes away. I'm frustrated that the rest of my body is so healthy, and I can keep working hard, but there's nothing I can do about the stupid cyst. 

So my question for you all is this: has anyone had to have a cyst surgically removed? How did it go? How was the recovery, and how long did it take? Did the removal help with your fertility Please help me put my mind at ease, because I'm freaking out a little!!!

Treating PCOS with other chronic illnesses?,"I was diagnosed with PCOS last week. I also have hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, recurrent pericarditis (from RA), Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, and severe endometriosis. 

The biggest recommendation from my doctor was to lose weight and cut out dairy, sugar, and gluten. I am currently 5’10” and 207 lbs. She recommends losing about 30 lbs at least. I am in recovery from an eating disorder and have only really recently corrected my relationship with food. I worry that restricting my diet in this way might be triggering for me and it feels defeating to “undo” all of the hard work I have done to not let food run my life. Suggestions? Has anyone worked with a nutritionist/dietician?

I am also struggling to come up with a low impact work out plan, which is what was recommended. Due to my hypermobility, arthritis, and cardiac issues, it is not advised for me to do high impact activities. I already walk 30-60 minutes a day with my dog. What other recommendations do you have? I have access to a gym and I am open to trying at home workouts too. 

Lastly, I am looking for supplements that you recommend. I was prescribed metformin but I would really like to start with supplements that might help with weight loss, energy, and inflammation first.

Ovary removal and fertility. Can anyone relate?,"**Can anyone relate to my story? What was your experience like? Hope?**

In January, I went to the ER for abdominal pain and vomiting. I had a super bad kidney infection the month prior and assumed what I was experiencing was related. The ER performed a CT and found a complex, 10cm ovarian cyst. It was a complete surprise. In hindsight, it shouldn't have been. I brushed off so many symptoms as ""just normal woman stuff"". Because of the pain and the fear of rupture or torsion, my doctor recommended surgery. My sister has had a nightmarish experience with ovarian cysts. I witnessed the pain she experienced and it terrified me. So that being said, I agreed to surgery. Fast forward to April, my doctors performed laparoscopic surgery. Once inside, the doctors discovered my situation is far worse than they expected. The cyst encompassed my entire ovary and there was no way to salvage it. So they removed my ovary. Recovery was hell including infection and abscesses. I needed another procedure to drain the first, very large abscess.

This past week, I went to hospital very sick assuming my surgical infection has returned or not completley gone away. The ER performed a CT and discovered many small cysts on my remaining ovary. The largest cyst measures about 2.5cm. I am on birth control now (I wasn't before) but my doctor said it won't treat the 2.5cm cyst. That means it can possibly grow as large as my previous cyst (or hopefully not). I know it's not horribly big but I'm really scared it will grow as big as my other cyst. I am scared of losing my last ovary. Since I had a horrible recovery, I am scared of needing surgery again. My sister has gone through the same exact thing. She lost both ovaries to giant cysts in about 2 years. The only difference being that she was much older than I am and had already started a family. I am only 22 years old and I dream of being pregnant and having children. I was just diagnosed with PCOS today. I'm so scared, hopeless, and heartbroken.

Can anyone else relate? What's your story? I would love to hear <3.

Is this workout routine PCOS friendly?,"I’m planning a summer workout routine to support weight loss with PCOS. I know that low-impact workouts are usually recommended to avoid spiking cortisol, so I’m trying to be intentional about balancing movement with recovery. My plan is to go to the gym on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for strength training. I’ll be using dumbbells and focusing on different muscle groups each day; my upper body on Monday, lower body on Wednesday, and core plus full-body on Friday. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I’ll go on 45 to 60 minutes walks, aiming to 2-3 miles. I’m also trying to prioritize sleep and high protein + fiber rich meals.

absence of ovulation??,"CONTENT WARNING pcos diagnosis, eating disorder recovery, and infertility: 

Does anyone else just not ovulate? It’s not like my ovulation and periods are irregular they’re nonexistent i don’t ovulate and don’t have periods and haven’t since i was 16. My weight has changed i was underweight the majority of my younger teen years 13-15, “normal weight” according to BMI when I was diagnosed 16, i put on lots of weight during ED recovery, i’ve lost over 65lbs and have had absolutely no change in my ovulation whatsoever. 

i’ve been diagnosed with pcos since 16 after noticing pain in my lower abdomen and not having a period for over a year (i was not on birth control during that time) they did 2 ultrasounds and blood work and i was diagnosed. I haven’t had an actual period since before my diagnosis. 

I was on nexplanon for 2 1/2 years didn’t have a period or any bleeding until around 6 months before getting it removed I talked to an ob/gyn and she said the bleeding was not a period just hormonal changes and it was probably time to get it removed so got it out in october. 

After i got it out i had constant spotting very lightly for about 4 days then i was spotting very very randomly here and there just like when i was on nexplanon but not a period just hormonal changes due to the removal according to 2 obgyns. 

eventually the spotting completely stopped and i contacted another doctor because i was concerned, when I went to that ob/gyn in january she said the same thing but also reviewed my whole history with me and said i likely haven’t ovulated since before my diagnosis and put me on 10mg provera for 10 days because she was concerned about me not having an actual period for a while. I got a period on 12th of 14 days of withdrawal it lasted 5 days and started metformin after my period was over. 

I’ve been off birth control since october, me and my partner regularly have unprotected sex and i’ve never gotten pregnant the obgyn told me and my partner pregnancy is very unlikely and i started metformin to hopefully start ovulating naturally but was told I will most likely need farther medical assistance to get pregnant. 

This is all both expected as i was told at 16 when i was diagnosed pregnancy would potentially be challenging but also heartbreaking because im 20 and haven’t ovulated since i was 16 years old. 

There’s a lot of feelings right now. it’s hard to accept that its not going to be as simple as everyone says like i hear people talk all the time about getting pregnant on accident and to hear my doctor talk about medications and treatments and ivf it’s a lot.

Venting,"I was self diagnosed (plus my coach) with PCOS a few months back when I got my IUD removed ((around September)). So many things worked better once it was removed. My recovery in the gym was faster/ better sleep/ sexual appetite is re-existing (for a hot minute I just thought I was becoming asexual)/ overall happier/ no more OAB issues. Yet I haven’t lost any of the 40lbs I’ve put on in the last two years. 
I got bloodwork the morning before my iud was removed, and then again 3 months later. My iud was masking all of my PCOS hormones as well as my insulin resistance. I was diagnosed by my doctor on the three month checkup. 
I’ve been on a new diet for a month now- with a whole slew of supplements. And yet I haven’t lost a single pound.  I was 189 a month ago and I’ve averaged 189 every week since. 

It’s insanely frustrating because although I was able to start my first period in 9 years via being on these supplements (I didn’t have one for 3 months post iud removal) I just think the insulin resistance is holding me back from progress. 

I’m a bodybuilder. I eat 80% of my diet as Whole Foods- things I cook/prep myself. And I strength train 4 days a week with a 10k daily step goal and 3 day of cardio a week. I follow protocol. I try as hard as I can to not cheat- because that would be a waste of my time and money. 

I asked my doctor if I would be able to start taking metformin and she said “let’s wait three months with your new diet, retest, and then see” but also it’s infuriating because I’m spending close to $300 a month on supplements…. When metformin is so much more affordable and would help my insulin resistance and then my FOOD would be better utilized and I wouldn’t need this insane supplement regime. 

I’m thinking about asking a different doctor to look at my bloodwork and see if I can be put on metformin…. It’s just so frustrating.

Non-hormonal contraceptives,"TW - living children/pregnancy 

I am 24 with a 4mo baby, diagnosed with PCOS in early 2021. I was taking Metformin 1500mg daily. I took this until I was 12 weeks pregnant. Have yet to start back. 

I was given the pill at my 6 week postnatal check up, I’ve been taking it now for 10 weeks and honestly I feel like shit. My acne has come back (yay 🙃) which I hadn’t had since coming off the pill in June 21. Periods are still all over the place even though I don’t have a ‘break’ on this pill, I have breakthrough bleeds at random points etc. 

I really do not want to take any more hormonal contraception, partly because of the side effects but also because it took me 19m to successfully conceive and I really think being on the pill for a significant amount of time before TTC played a role in that. 

I absolutely do not want to get pregnant again for at least another 2 years at a minimum. I had an emergency c-section, horrible pregnancy and hard recovery so another child is not something I want to even give any thought to yet.

Is it worth pushing for a diagnosis?,"Hi all, I'll try to keep this brief, but I'm feeling pretty confused about whether to keep pushing for answers or not. I have a history of abnormal testosterone levels going back to childhood (age 9), have been on extended BC for ~10 years to manage severe PMS symptoms, and then about a year and a half ago got put on spironolactone to manage hormonal acne. I have dealt with health issues all my life, then after being mysteriously sick for 4 years, got diagnosed with celiac disease 2 years ago. Doctor said that a lot of the symptoms I was having would resolve with a gluten free diet - despite being in full recovery from celiac (meaning the diet is working internally) I still have a lot of symptoms that I've been trying to get help for. I met with an endocrinologist a few months ago because I have a history of a previous endocrine disorder and the history of high testosterone. She did not want to take me off the BC to do proper testing, but had me discontinue the spironolactone to see what effect that was having, going off of it my acne returned and I gained 10 pounds over the course of a month. 

Long story short, all the testing came back normal. I asked if it was worth going off of BC to get a formal PCOS diagnosis, she said no because I'm ""already being treated for PCOS"" but... what if something (BC, spiro dose) needs to be different? I asked this and she suggested I follow up with a gynecologist, which feels dismissive. 

All of this to say, is it worth trying to get a formal diagnosis? I know from reading through this sub that other people have been given different treatments that have helped them, and this endo seems to not be considering that as a possibility. I scheduled a check-in with my PCP this week to discuss all of this with her and see if she has any suggestions, but I'm really running out of hope that I'm going to be stuck living my life struggling with fatigue, brain fog, severe bloating - all of which make my life harder than it needs to be.

advice for my friend please ,"Hi everyone,

I super love and appreciate the stories and community support on this sub. It’s really helped me with my own PCOS diagnosis, which has been managed pretty well for almost a year. However, this story isn’t about me. 

My best friend of 12 years had suspected PCOS, and I had referred her to my general doctor who has been completely understanding and helpful when navigating my own diagnosis. He was able to refer her out for labs (and when the hormone panel came back normally, similar to my story), she was referred out for a transvag ultrasound (also how I was diagnosed).

But she never made it. Immense and sudden pain came the day of the scheduled scan. Two trips to the ER and gynecologist for an emergency follow up transvag scan, her ovaries were shown to be covered with large, inflamed cysts. It was so bad that they described her ovaries as “inflamed” and “absolutely covered.” They did a follow up CT the next day after a night of excruciating pain (to check for appendicitis/her bladder/all that good stuff) and noted that several smaller cysts were left, and the large ones had probably ruptured. 

This leads us to now. She is still in dull pain, after seeing the outpatient family doctor again. Her anxiety is horrible, she is constantly nauseous, feverish, and clammy. She cannot be left alone, so she has come to stay in my family’s guest room. The issue is, I have never seen her like this. Does anyone have any advice or a timeline for what healing from something like this looks like? My PCOS is relatively managed, and any cysts I have had burst have been smaller and during my period, not ovulation, and never been bad enough to hospitalize me. She is not a crier and has a pain tolerance of steel, and yet has been weaker than I’ve ever seen her in our entire friendship. She is supposed to return to work in two days but cannot be alone. Any advice to healing and recovery window would be so appreciated.

**Worth noting between the ER/gyno they gave her pain meds, anxiety meds, metformin, progesterone based BC, and something for nausea.

Laparoscopic cystectomy recovery time,"hi all, my wife has PCOS and had a laparoscopic cystectomy 5 days ago for a 7.4cm cyst on her left ovary. her doctor was thankfully able to remove the cyst without taking the entire ovary but my wife is still in incredible pain even with the painkillers. sitting up hurts more than standing up, and she can only stand up for a few minutes at a time before feeling hot and extremely tired. the bleeding also hasn't gotten any better and it's still pretty heavy.

her incisions don't look infected and dont feel warm/hot, and when my wife says she feels hot it's her whole body like a hot flash but i can't feel it on the outside of her body at all. the pain is the biggest concern for her since she works from home and was expected to go back to work tomorrow but can't even sit up long enough to finish a meal so sitting at her desk for 8 hours is out of the question.

my wife doesn't want to go to the emergency room for the pain because she can't bear to sit up long enough for the car ride AND in the waiting room. we also can't afford it since surgery was so much more expensive than expected even after insurance and we haven't even gotten the final bill yet.

Anyone recovering post-Metformin use? Help!,"I'm wondering if anyone here has had to quit metformin due to awful GI side effects, and what has your digestive recovery looked like. For reference, I quit Metformin about two weeks ago after being on it 5-6 months. 

  
I was on a very low dose of Metformin cream for helping to manage my PCOS symptoms. I used the cream form to avoid the digestive upset because I have a veeery sensitive system. (My microbiome has been troubled ever since dealing with chronic low stomach acid.)

  
The lotion was going great at first. After using it for 2-3 months, however, I started developing increasingly bad digestive symptoms that I've never had before. My doctor thinks the lotion had a delayed reaction as it built up potency in my system over time. 

  
My symptoms have been very much like Bile Acid Malabsorption (BAM). I started having severe episodes after eating fatty meals especially. My bm's were always soft, fiery feeling, and green or yellow in color. Then it became full on diarrhea over time. Also, after I would apply the lotion, I would feel a pretty immediate reaction in my gut. Lots of gurgles, gas, and painful bm's.

I came across a science article called **""Metformin and the Gastrointestinal Tract""** that explains what could be going on. It's pretty interesting, but a bit over my head. It states in the article: *""The efficacy of metformin is in part mediated by the gut -- potentially by direct effects on glucose update and metabolism, by directly or indirectly increasing GLP-1, by an increase in bile acid exposure and by altering the microbiome.""*

  
Desperate for relief, I gave up and stopped using Metformin a couple of weeks ago. Everything in my gut calmed down for a couple of days, but has since ramped up again. I no longer feel like I'm improving. I really hope whatever damage was done can be resolved soon. 

I'm not looking for a way to go back on Metformin, as it just isn't a fit for me. But I am curious if others have had this experience and what their recovery has been like. Did anything help you in particular other than giving it time?

  
FOR THE RECORD... I think Metformin is great for those who benefit from it and can tolerate it. It just isn't for me, unfortunately.

Please Help Me!,"Hi all!

My PCOS symptoms have been hirsutism, acne (in the past) and being subfertile (I have had one child naturally, though). I eat in moderation (don't count carbs) and always stay very slim with muscle definition. 

I think that my hair has been thinning and I am freaking out! I thought it was happening due to having COVID a few months ago, me upping the ante on my already intense workouts and possibly because I don't sleep much these days (that might cause stress on my body). Now I think it is probably PCOS-related. 

I am thinking about going low carb or keto to hopefully stop the hair loss/thinning and am wondering how long it took some of you guys to notice a difference in your hair after doing one of those things? Any positive stories of ""hair recovery"" is appreciated right now.

diane-35 experiences?,"hi everyone! officially got diagnosed with pcos today (17F), even though my ultrasound was relatively clean and my hormones aren’t out of range. instead, i have irregular periods, acne, and i’m insulin resistant, so now ive got a prescription for diane-35 birth control

i’m just wanting to know what people’s experiences have been on this pill? my biggest concern is the possible weight gain, i’m currently 5’4 and 60kg (which is definitely a healthy weight), and that’s been pretty unchanging for a while. but i haven’t always had the best relationship with my weight and i was bulimic for a couple years, so i’m just a little worried that if i suddenly gain weight it’ll be a bit of a dent in my ed recovery :(

Keeping Keto for PCOS & IF even in ED Recovery,"In my teens and 20s I had compulsive overeating disorder. I was 500 lbs and type 2 diabetic as well as every other pain and illness that goes along with being that level overweight. Through all of those years I tried low carb diets and eliminating just sugar (desserts and sweets), and nothing really worked. I embraced the keto lifestyle and eventually lost over 250 lbs over a couple of years. Now in my 30's I have been diagnosed with OSFED (atypical anorexia and atypical orthorexia), and Over Exercising - from which I was able to get down to 214 lbs the first time regained to about 268 lbs- weight went up and down, then I was able to get to 216 this second relapse. I am in my second recovery period in the past 3 years, with having all of my EDs for about 4 or 5 years. In this second recovery I want to be rid of my EDs for good this time. I have eliminated exercise (minus daily walks- those are super casual and not very far or strenuous), Intermittent Fasting, and caloric restriction. The thing I will not eliminate is keto. I treat sugar and refined carbs as things that I am allergic to that will cause me pain and health issues, because they WILL push me back to Type 2 Diabetes and morbid obesity.

  
I have PCOS and really bad Insulin Resistance, and I take hormone medication (10mg of Norethindrone) where I never have a period. Is it ok to continue with keto? Hell, I don't monitor my carbs at the moment, I just eat what I want in recovery of keto foods which are naturally high in fat and protein and low in glycemic index. I am probably around 50 net carbs per day- though I refuse to count because numbers feed my EDs through my OCD. I do not want to go back to the 500 lbs, not so much for the weight itself, but for how pained and miserable I felt for most of my life being that ill. Sugar and refined carbohydrates were so toxic to my body. I just need reassurance that continuing to avoid them is not self-sabotage. I don't crave them, feel deprived of them, or feel I need them. Following keto for the past 7 years, I can make or buy a keto version of anything that is made from sugar or refined carbs. I actually enjoy the keto versions more upon reflection- mostly because the keto versions do not make me feel sick when sugar used to have an immediate negative effect on me.  


The only thing I can liken this to is for folks with Celiac or Hashimoto's who have to stay away from sugar and gluten so they don't get sick from it. What do you guys think? Have any of you ever been through anything like this?

  
\*\*\*I am not promoting extreme weight loss and I am not promoting morbid obesity. Both are so very unhealthy, as are the EDs that typically lead to both. I am trying to learn and promote body positivity and intuitive eating. Let's all try to be happy and healthy and listen to our bodies. ED recovery is one of the hardest things I have ever had to deal with. I'll be damned if I have to do it a third time. I don't want anyone else to have to go through it either!

Elevated DHEA-S. Is this PCOS?,"Hello everyone. I recently got some of my hormone tests results back, and I don't really know what they mean. I was hoping some of you would understand these results and see if it could be PCOS or not?

My FSH, LH, estradiol, and estrogen levels are low. My testosterone (both free and regular) are on the higher end of normal (freaking out about that). However, the main thing that I'm concerned about is my DHEA-S level, which was 1696. 

For some background, I have been suffering from a restrictive eating disorder for about 6 years now, and I'm actively in recovery. I'm still undereating, but it is nowhere as bad as before. I lost my period quickly when I started restricting at the very beginning of my ED, and I never got it back. I'm thinking it might be hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA), but some sites say that in malnourished people DHEA levels are low. I'm also a very anxious person, so could this be the reason why it's elevated?

Advice needed,"Hello all!

Reaching out because I can't find any information.

I have PCOS (overweight, insulin resistant, pre-diabetic, pcos belly, chin hair, insomnia) and have had it since I was 12 (24 now).  I went years without bleeding. Then literal years bleeding. I found a doctors office that took me seriously around age 22 and have been working with them. I was not ovulating. we tried to make me cycle with provera (progesterone) and it didnt work. in october of 2023 I started bleeding very heavily (almost was an er situation) and was in extreme pain. Doctor scheduled a DNC and scraped my lining/ removed a polyp. That helped definitely with the volume of bleeding but I still started bleeding every day again. But i was diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia. had to see a gyno oncologist and make a plan so it didnt turn into cancer and get a IUD. a Bilateral Ovarian Wedge Resection BOWR, DNC, stage 1 endo removal, a rando fibrous tumor removed,  and IUD insertion was done at end of feb 2024. Recovery was rough the first couple of weeks and resulted in multiple visits/stays at hospital. had the follow up appointment and the results from the dnc were good- no sign of the hyperplasia, dont need to take this medicine they were going to have me take (makes you go into menopausal state), and the IUD wasnt necessary. All great news. fast forward to today- I had the IUD removed as it was causing consistent cramping/mood swings. Instead of that I have to take the provera again for 15 days out of each month and have another dnc in 6 months. I have reached out and asked why we can't let my body try to cycle on its own after the BOWR?

Has anyone has similar issues?

 I am planning to start strength training soon, but I understand that a high-carb diet is not advisable for PCOS. This sounds a little bit challenging, as I'm concerned that limiting carbs could affect my exercise performance. Also, it makes it difficult to reach my daily calorie intake goals, and accordingly affecy recovery.

SubReddit groups of people that are helpful/skilled with all kinds of pelvic pain:
r/endo r/endometriosis r/adenomyosis r/pcos
r/fibroids and also r/pmdd . 

And a heads up: In my experience regular OBGYN’s are notoriously bad at treating pelvic pain/excessive bleeding - I cannot stress enough how untrained they are to treat or even talk about these diseases let alone make the diagnoses or do the (delicate and complex) surgery.    

Specialists in pelvic disorders (above links or ask your local endometriosis nonprofit) are the doctors for the least amount of suffering in the long run. 

YOU NEED NUMBERS: Painful periods are a societal problem and we’re not supposed to have to face this alone. Bring someone (or 2 or 3) with you to your doctors appointments.  Even if they know nothing about your situation. It doesn’t matter if they hear about your vagina or your uterus or your diarrhea. It matters that you have someone there as a United front. Because our medical system mistreats people in pain. FaceTime or call your person in to the appt if you need to. Or even schedule overlapping appointments and call in your general doctor/practitioner to advocate for you (it’s their job). 

Also, here are some things you can say* to your doctor:

“- My worst symptoms have been pain/fatigue. I am unable to function like I used to. The pain/fatigue is wearing on my body, and I am increasingly tired as each monthly cycle passes.   I cannot function normally and my work/family/school/happiness is increasingly difficult because of my body.
-I am not leaving this office until something is done.
— I am done being in pain/bleeding/etc.. What would you suggest for LONG TERM RELIEF from these symptoms?: Then wait for their response, which should be/needs-to-be a referral to a pelvic disorder or endometriosis specialist. 
- This pain is impairing my ability to work and my ability to live life. It is draining my energy and ability to function. 
- I need a long-term solution for this pain. It is hurting and debilitating me. I need a solution that provides the least amount of suffering to me and the least risk for me and my body in the long term…..(and then just allow silence…let them respond.)
- I’m looking for long-term resolution for     my pain/bleeding - what’s the best way to make that happen? 
- I am not interested in nor do I have the energy for short term fixes.
- I do not have the energy to keep pursuing these different treatments. I have experienced too much pain/bleeding. I am tired. I need a long-term solution.
- What is the solution with the highest long term success rate? How can we make the solution happen as quickly as possible?
- I want a pelvic disorder doctor with the highest skill and success rate.  I want a significant reduction in my pain. Who can help with this? 
- It sounds like you (OBGYN) want to do the surgery. Can you tell me what fellowship training you’ve had specifically in surgery for excising Endometriosis?  How many endometriosis-specific excision only surgeries have you done in the past year? (Reader be careful here: regular, untrained OBGYN’s in my experience will omit and twist the truth regarding their lack of experience, practice and training with Endometriosis.) 
- It sounds like you want to do another prescription/medication/round of PT/ultrasound/MRI/x-ray/bloodworkup. I am tired. But I will do these things if it will get me closer to surgery with a pelvic disorder specialist surgeon. Is that what will happen after I do these next steps that are asking for?
-I would like to test the functioning of my ovarian tubes and my ureters since endometriosis can grow on these. 
- Even though my pain/bleeding is not constant, I still would like a resolution.
- Even though my pain/bleeding is NOT cyclical, I still would like resolution. Endo pain is constant in many people. 
-I am aware cysts often go away in their own, but if I have Endometriosis the cysts will keep growing and causing pain. I would like the endometriosis removed so the cysts don’t grow back.

-I am asking for a referral to an Endometriosis or pelvic disorder specialist and it sounds like you are telling me “no”. If that’s true I need you to note in my chart today that I asked you and you declined to provide a referral. I’ll wait while you do that.

-I may be willing to try xyz antidepressant, but this pelvic pain is the biggest contributor to my depressed/anxious mood and I would like to treat that first via surgery or in tandem with antidepressant.”

(*Pain: Also replace with any of these words: bloating, excessive bleeding, clots (can be fibroids), IBS symptoms, urinating issues – urgency and peeing pants, bowel issues – urgency, diarrhea, hip pain, pain under the butt/pelvic/peritoneal/groin/undercarriage, sciatic area pain, low/mid back pain, lateral thigh pain, abdomen pain, stomach pain. Anything that originated in the pelvis deserves care from a pelvic disorder specialist doctor, and so that’s who you need to get in front of for a consult.)

TIMING: If you can, try scheduling - once a month appointments with your regular doctor or gynecologist - for ON the days your period starts. Keep doing these monthly appointments until you get the help you need. 

VERBALIZE SYMPTOMS: And remember when you’re talking to your doctor, you need to verbally describe in detail, factually, how the symptoms are when they are at their worst - when they have incapacitated you the most - even if that was in your teen years. Ex. The pain doubled me over. I was curled up in a ball on the floor from pain. I was screaming/crying from pain. The blood was soaking my pants/running down my legs when I’m at work.  The bloating is so much I can’t bend forward. My hips hurt so much I can’t lay on my side for long. 

WHO TO TRUST: I avoid professionals who: see me visibly wince and pull away during the pelvic exam and don’t acknowledge it; do not ever send follow up surveys regarding my recovery and their services. 

Good luck on your journey. And just a reminder that your body is the most important thing in your life. By far the most important thing.  You deserve every chance to have a fully functioning body - a body that is as healthy as it can possibly be. So whatever it takes time, money, effort, human support, you deserve that.

weight & pcos,"**content warning: weight, eating disorder**
okay but does anyone have experience with weight loss helping pcos? The follow up question is what tf is the “ideal weight” for someone with PCOS?! 

When I was diagnosed with PCOS at 16 I was at a low/average BMI & weight. I had a rough battle with ED recovery but my body has seemingly learned how to handle not starving. My lab results have consistently been better than they have in 5 years even from before my diagnosis back when when my BMI & weight were low/average. 

Currently my weight is at a pretty steady decline (for no apparent reason but i digress) However it just seems like there is no good news when it comes to pcos. 

My all of labs are well within normal range I’m the same height I was at my diagnosis my labs were bad then because of ED related complications but my weight itself was not a “risk causing” factor at diagnosis. 

I am now no longer a 16 year old child and do not wish to be the same weight as on but the question remains what tf is the “ideal weight” for someone  with PCOS because some of my doctors like my  cardiologist and neurologist say BMI is outdated and not an accurate measurement of health and have reassured me my labs don’t indicate any weight related concerns but some doctors love to use like it’s the law. 

I believe it’s important to note my breast alone weigh 18lbs and have not gotten even the slightest smaller after losing over 60lbs. So yes 5’3-5’4 and 190lbs might be a concern some but none of my clothes are plus size anymore not pants or tops my labs are great i look and feel great but everywhere says losing weight helps my ob/gyn mentions weight loss as management suggestions as part of my aftervist papers but it’s just a print off from one of the sources the offices uses but no one has ever told me the ideal like what exactly i’m aiming for weight wise. Because if my labs are normal, my body is maintaining itself efficiently, what am i supposed to be achieving with weigh loss??",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/19dk52a/weight_pcos/,1,1706000140.0,/r/PCOS/comments/19dk52a/weight_pcos/
Metabolism and sustainable weight loss/ED history and advice,"Hi there,

I am 20F and recently(ish) started my PCOS treatment journey. I have a family history of PCOS, with both my grandmother and mother being very lean(although my grandmother has an ED), but with polycystic ovaries and high cholesterol, and my mom with hypoglycemia(insulin resistance?). I've always had irregular periods since I started them just before I was 14, but thought it was due to an eating disorder also active, then attributed it to birth control(skipping placebo pills). 

  
**\*\*heads up: specific weight and calorie count numbers included below\*\***

Over the course of about 15-18 months, I went from 125-ish lbs stabilizing after eating disorder recovery to just shy of 185lbs at my highest. I thought at the time the weight gain was due to a combination of antipsychotic medications, smoking, and relationship weight. As with the weight gain, more noticeable PCOS symptoms followed apart from irregular periods such as more chin hair, ""mustache hair"", and stomach hair. I felt sluggish and swollen.

I felt that despite calorie counting and slightly increasing activity last fall, I was not losing weight as quickly as to be expected(was still around 170lbs), and was confused. I went to a gyno in early January and was prescribed Yaz and Metformin. I also take Spironolactone, and I have been taking Spearmint and Inositol and supplementing B12 and D3. I started strength training 3-4x per week (45-90 minutes each session), and seriously cutting out added sugar as much as possible and avoiding a lot more refined carbs and prioritizing protein. This has led to great results! I went from 168-170(I think? Maybe 165?)lbs to 153 today-so about 10-15lbs in six weeks or so. I'm building muscle quickly and I am very happy. My goal is somewhere in the neighborhood of 130-145lbs(I'm 5'4""), but body composition and symptom management is most important and I don't want to regain the weight.

So, what's the problem/question?

Well, I've noticed that I've been eating a lot less. I'm not hungry a lot, and even when I am sometimes I don't find low-carb options or I've eaten less other days and don't want to mess up progress. Most days for the past 2 weeks or so, I drink a 20g low carb 130cal protein shake, eat maybe a snack of some fruit and/or nuts, and then usually one low-ish carb meal with protein and healthy fats and LOTS of fruit and veg and lemon water.  I don't really count calories as I find generally keeping to 2 or less meals and focusing on macros and vegetables and fruits is enough and I can get very obsessive with numbers, but from a realistic estimate it is likely under 1200 calories on average per day, with a few days definitely dipping in the sub-1000 calorie range.

This is all well and good, but I am worried about slowing down my metabolism and I am scared to change these habits and undo my hard work. I also want to be careful not to trigger ED thoughts and behaviors and get in a bad mental and physical cycle, but I really want to lose this weight and feel healthy and pretty and I don't want to be too lax. I'm also worried about slowing down metabolism or not sticking to the plan and regaining the weight, and I want this to be a sustainable lifestyle change. I've noticed it makes social gatherings sometimes more difficult, and while my cravings have thankfully been very merciful and manageable, I want to keep them that way and still have some more typically ""comfort"" or enjoyable foods fit in while staying on track.

I'm wondering what I can do to increase my metabolism without gaining weight and still manage PCOS symptoms and be able to be socially participate and have a balanced lifestyle? I know it might get progressively to lose the last 10-20lbs considering deficit and proportional fat loss and keep my muscle mass up. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1iqpchs/metabolism_and_sustainable_weight_lossed_history/,1,1739701135.0,/r/PCOS/comments/1iqpchs/metabolism_and_sustainable_weight_lossed_history/
"26F - Long story but need advice and to vent if anyone cares to read, feeling lost and confused, big question is HRT for amenorrhea safe?","So this is a bit of a lengthy story but looking to see if anyone has any similar issues that has been on hormone replacement therapy at my age or dealt with similar circumstances with gut health, hormone issues and medications. I really need to vent and rant.

So this all started last year in December 2021, I went skiing and was taken on an intermediate slope with my now ex bf and his family with no experience. I had no idea what I was doing on a very high slope lost control and immediately crashed and ended up tearing 3 ligaments in my knee. After 2 years together he then attempted to ghost me when we got home and then dumped me via phone 1 week after we got home and we never spoke again. I had reconstructive surgery for ACL/Meniscus in February of 2022 and have spent the entirety of this year in recovery/PT trying to heal my leg, my mind and my heart and now my entire body.

The last time I had a period was 2/2/22, the day I went into surgery. Ever since then I have not had a period (8 months now) and in that 8 months I have developed a plethora of issues and symptoms that led me to finding out about PCOS. My hair has been thinning/falling out, my skin has completely freaked out and I have cystic acne that I never had in my life. I bloat to a distended belly 24/7 with everything I eat or drink and am in constant discomfort. I have gained almost 30 pounds over the course of this year and I cannot lose weight for the life of me. I suffer from chronic migraines to the point of throwing up sometimes. I spoke to my OBGYN and she ran some labs, my blood work showed elevated testosterone levels and high cortisol levels and diagnosed me with PCOS and wanted me to go on birth control. I was prescribed spironolactone for my acne and testosterone levels which I have been on for 4 months and have had no progress just acne that gets worse and worse, my new doc suggested weaning off of this medication as it has had zero positive effect. 

I wanted a more holistic approach so I sought out to see Dr Felice Gersh, an OBGYN and Integrative medicine practice. I saw her PA and we ran even more labs and after reviewing them she doesn’t believe I have PCOS anymore, but isn’t ruling it out entirely. She diagnosed me with hypothalamic amenorrhea, my labs also showed that I have thyroiditis, there are TPO antibodies present in my body and nearing levels of getting a thyroid disease like hypo/hyperthyroidism. I can't recall exactly what the blood work said but there was something about my free testosterone and FSH levels that she believe indicated opposite of what we would see in PCOS patients. Additionally I have MTHFR Gene Mutation. I also have high levels of mercury in my body I am not detoxing. She said that what is happening overall is less of a reproductive system (ovaries, uterus) issue as it is my brain and pituitary gland, which is not sending pulsatory signals to release hormones. My hormone levels are at menopausal levels and she wants me to go on hormone replacement therapy. I will wear a patch of estradiol every day and from days 1-14 of each month I will take a progesterone. She said I wouldn't get any side effects but I know that with most medications I go on I end up with bad side effects. I'm a little afraid to go on HRT but I know I need to do something to help my body. Has anyone ever experienced amenorrhea and gone on HRT? 

From what I understand hypothalamic amenorrhea is seen in a lot of people with eating disorders or people who over exercise. I don't believe I fall in either category currently as I have quite a healthy diet and workout consistently (I switch off between physical therapy, walking, hot yoga, strength training) I am gluten free, dairy free, I eat 3 meals a day with 1-2 snacks, I avoid inflammatory ingredients and mostly all processed foods with the occasional treat like gluten free baking or gluten free pasta. I eat plenty of fruit veggies and protein and healthy fat. I take vitamins and supplements every day including Vitamin D, Magnesium, Ubiquinol, B12 Folate, L-Glutamine, Colostrum, Acnutrol for acne, Vitamin C, and Zinc. But because of my leaky gut I am not absorbing any nutrients. I no longer fit in any of my clothes except a pair of overalls and my leggings. I can't lose weight no matter what I try. I have so much happening and feel so out of control of my body. I have no self-confidence I am depressed and isolating I can't seem to feel like I can manage my life. I can't wake up in the morning I am exhausted all the time, I have extremely bad brain fog and feel like I have short term memory loss issues. I feel constantly anxious and stressed and I have to figure out how to be less stressed in order to fix these issues but I dont know how. 

I am really scared I have a pituitary adenoma, a tumor on the pituitary gland as my mom had one develop and went through all these same issues when she was my age. My doctor said it is a possibility and we haven't ruled it out but going to try approaching healing in a few other ways before getting an MRI. I just hope it isn't a brain tumor. 

I will say that I have been through quite some trauma in my life...physically and mentally abusive boyfriends, narcissistic abuse, sexual assault, 2 head injuries/concussions, car crash from being hit by a drunk driver, years of depression and anxiety, sepsis, miscarriage, knee surgery, heartbreak. I get why my body is unwell but it just sucks because after years and years of struggles and hurt and pain I had finally gotten to a point in my life of stability and happiness at the end of 2020 and now it feels like its all being torn away. I feel like all the progress I made is dissipating and I'm just truly heart broken for myself. On top of that I feel like a crazy person because my hormones are so effed. I go from crying my eyes out to completely fine to hearing a song and crying all over again to laughing at a tv show. I am constantly on the verge of tears for seemingly no reason. I do not see myself when I look in the mirror and I don't feel like myself at all. It seems as if my injury and surgery was a catalyst for setting off all these issues. 

If anyone has any advice or experience on hormone replacement therapy for young females, weight loss, stress management, leaky gut I'm all ears.

Yoga/exercise suggestions with PCOS pain?,"I deal with joint and muscle pain, as well as horrid fatigue, thanks to my PCOS and the weight it has put on me.  I also had COVID last spring and am still dealing with the fallout from that (edema, shortness of breath, additional pain). I’ve been making slow dietary changes with the help of my therapist and doctor (eating disorder recovery is not an overnight thing, so please don’t suggest keto), but I would really like to find some beginner-friendly and sustainable sort of exercise. I walk a lot and am on my feet most of the day for work, and I would start swimming again, but....well....swimming pools around here aren’t open due to COVID. My therapist recommended yoga for stress relief and pain relief, but most routines that I’ve found involve positions that I just can’t get my body with into, between being big (and big-breasted!!!) and rather inflexible to start. Even ones that say “beginner-friendly” don’t seem all that doable.

Diagnosed and idk where to start ,"I’ve been diagnosed with PCOS, I also have PMDD. I also have really large clotty periods And I have no clue where to start for “recovery”. I’ve been told birth control, metformin, inositol. I’m just so overwhelmed. I tried inositol-d? And it made me anxious. Anyway, is there someone who can give me a step by step of how to go about recovering, please? (Also, is a gyno best or endocrinologist?)

Workout supplements / acne,"I've had severe cystic acne basically my whole life, but have been recently diagnosed with pcos. I'm trying to get back into working out and am looking for some supplements that won't break out. I stick to plant based proteins but rarely take it. I drink BCAAs as a pre workout because I don't really need the extra caffeine, mainly for muscle recovery and placebo effect.  

I know working out will cause break outs but I feel like I'm purging way more than usual. I stay away from Biotin because it makes me break out extremely! This kind of feels like a biotin break out.

Does anyone have any suggestions on supplements that limit break outs? Help is appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/14ct0i8/workout_supplements_acne/,1,1687117067.0,/r/PCOS/comments/14ct0i8/workout_supplements_acne/
Weight loss progress,"So I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 16 (currently 27), long story short, I was able to see a gynecologist and get diagnosed because they had found a teratoma cyst on my ovary… After it all made sense the irregular periods, excessive facial and body hair, and dark skin in my armpits but at that time I was still a 125lbs so I was not overweight. I got surgery to remove the cyst (laparotomy) and did gain some weight while in recovery reached 140lbs but not a lot I got in the gym and went down to 130lbs within a year. Around the time I turned 20 I started gaining weight rapidly and couldn’t shed it off as easily as before I tried diets and killed myself in the gym but nothing was working. I reached to be 240lbs but finally in the past year I have slowly gone down to 175lbs. Now I was so happy with my progress but of course my PCOS had to one up me and my doctor discovered another dermoid cyst on my ovary which I need surgery for. Now I know I’m not going to be able to go to the gym right away but I don’t have much experience maintaining weight in situation like this and I would really hate to lose all my progress so if there’s anyone that has gone through something similar or can give any advice , I would greatly appreciate it, thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1id7js5/weight_loss_progress/,1,1738192213.0,/r/PCOS/comments/1id7js5/weight_loss_progress/
Will my hair grow back?,"So about two months ago, I had a horrible case of seborrheic dermatitis (which after a lot of research I’ve found out can be a product of high DHT/testosterone) which caused massive hair loss. As a result, it made me pay more attention to my hair and I started to realise that I’ve been losing my hair since the beginning of the year and a lot of other aspects in my life point towards PCOS also. I’m terrified as I’m a 21 year old who’s always had thick hair. I’m working with a dermatologist and hoping to get on spironolatone by the end of next week and also get on birth control (im going to ask for yas). I’m also making loads of lifestyle changes for my insulin resistance and going to my GP next week to take about taking inositol (pretty obvious now that I always had this too in hindsight). ive also noticed that above my temple, I’ve had hair miniaturisation and it’s only accelerated in the past few months. i guess my question is, will my hair ever be the same again or close to the same? I really don’t want to use minoxidil due to my dermatitis and not wanting to be reliant on it for the rest of my life.

"After years of suspecting, PCOS was confirmed 6/16/25 at my MRI","I want to apologize in advance for how long my rant is! As a precursor I was diagnosed with Endometriosis on 3/15/17, at that point I had fought for 3yrs to get a Laparoscopy, my period pain had changed drastically after having my son via C-Section in 2014. I've long suspected that I had PCOS, I would double over in pain when I would get sharp pains in my ovaries that would come and go so quickly. After a painful and heart breaking miscarriage (3 in total) in Sept 2023 I sought out a new OB for a Hysterectomy.  2/19/24 is my Uterus Yeet date (my R ovary and fallopian tubes were fused with it) and requested they take everything.  Against my wishes my Left ovary was kept in, ""it looked normal and you need your ovaries since you are under the age of 45"" was the explanation I was given. Recovery was rough but I got through it.  April 2024 I started to feel like my old self,  even obtained Employee of the Month at my job. May and June were good months but I started noticing pain and discomfort on my left side at random times.  July 18th, 2 days after my 36th Birthday, I was hit with horrendous pain that made me double over.  I was shaking and aching all over with body chills. That familiar sharp stabbing pain in my booty hole also returned (the flare up lasted for 2wks). I called my OB and thus began a new journey. 8/15 I finally had a Transvaginal ultrasound, they found a cyst the size of a golf ball.  They suggested giving it a month to see if it goes away, more pain occured.  9/26 ultrasound revealed it was the size of Grapefruit and full of endo/blood. Surgery set for 11/14/25. 10/22/24 i ended up in the ER with severe constipation from ALL of the meds I was taking around the clock as ordered by my OB, had to have an Enema. Surgery was rescheduled to 11/15. The day finally arrives, my Dr didn't show up until the very last minute,  but I was prepped to go. When she arrived she came to see me,  told me the plan and kissed my forehead before she left (Odd asf) Was finally wheeled back, Put under anesthesia. An hour later I'm coming to,  the recovery nurse tells me they could not complete my surgery and my left ovary was still intact. I was told the Ovary was embedded into my bowel and I need to see a MIGS specialist (Minimally Invasive Gynecological Surgeon) I was so angry. The referral is sent, the office calls me to schedule. She has no openings until 5/14/25 and she is a 2hr drive away, I'm devastated but book it and ask to be on the waitlist for any openings. 1/2/25 I end up in the ER after having so many bowel issues and blood in my stool. A CT is done that shows the Ovary is still embedded in my bowel but I have no GI bleeds and I'm diagnosed with a Hemrhoid the next 6 months are agony, but thankfully I extended my FMLA. No openings came up, May rolls around, I go and meet her. She is so nice and caring, she asked for every detail of this journey that started in 2014 after having my son via c-section. We both agree surgery is needed and I ask for an MRI to be done first. 6/1/25 is the scheduled MRI at my local hospital network, the system gets hacked on 5/20/25 so my appt gets cancelled while they sort things out.  I schedule 2hrs away with the new network my specialist is from for 6/13/25. In the time of waiting the ovary is in a flare up and I'm in agony. The hacked hospital network calls to reschedule for 6/16, i take it to avoid the 2hr drive.  The day finally arrives,  i undergo it and wait.  Mychart results come in that night,  PCOS is confirmed (as i always suspected). 6/20  I have a virtual appt with my specialist, we agree surgery is needed, she wants me on Gabbapentin until then.  Monday 6/23 her office will call me to schedule it. Why did I have to go thru all of that to get to this point? Why didnt they do an MRI before the Hysterectomy, it would have savede so much time.  Just why? Why is everything so F.cked up in order to get help?",https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1lh5vcf/after_years_of_suspecting_pcos_was_confirmed/,1,1750537282.0,/r/PCOS/comments/1lh5vcf/after_years_of_suspecting_pcos_was_confirmed/

(20F) My acne flared on a levonorgestrel combined pill; does this indicate PCOS?,"Hi all,

I would be extremely grateful for your advice/opinions on my condition. I am aware that it is dangerous and ridiculous to diagnose myself with anything on the advice of strangers over the internet but would be interested if others have suffered something similar.

I have never been formally diagnosed with PCOS (though doctors have suspected it) because every time I have had blood tests, the out of whack levels have always been put down to my anorexia and recovery. My irregular periods has also been put down to this (and earlier in my life, just down to my age). 

So what I'm really asking is if it is normal for acne to flare in a woman without PCOS when taking a combined pill containing levonorgestrel, or whether this is another piece of evidence I can add to my attempt to understand the **root** cause of my relentless acne.

Diet and DIM Supplement.,"Does anyone else find doing research very very very frustrating when it comes to trying to help yourself balance your own hormones?

For example, you will go to one site which tells you to eat protein and then you go to another and see this. "" A high protein diet [causes a decrease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10634401) in the production of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), which is vital to reducing testosterone levels — something that’s critical in PCOS recovery. ""

Also, I don't know if I'm Oestrogen dominant or low, so I don't even know whether to avoid Phytoestrogens in foods or not. But I decided to look up foods high in them just in case and is it just me, but nearly every healthy food contains Phytoestrogens. Like am I supposed to just live on three carrots a day for the rest of my life?!

It's ridiculous, even researching leaves you stressed out which does not help your PCOS.

Anyway, during my researching, I've found a supplement called DIM. Which I'm also getting conflicting theories that it releases extra free testosterone in the body whilst helping with the oestrogen and progesterone balance and some say it doesn't cause testosterone effects at all and actually has anti-androgen effects.

Has anyone else heard about this or know of it and is anyone here taking DIM and found it helps?

Are the rest of you concerned about eating too many foods which contain Phytoestrogens or do you just stick to a low carb and no sugar diet?

I'm really interested to know what a lot of you eat or don't eat that you have found to be helpful or beneficial?

I'm feeling so done with this most days where I just cry and feel like I've had enough and then I have days where I want to fight this and do what I can to help and heal my body.

Thank you for reading this far and any information will be really appreciated!

Low estrogen level and brain fog,"In my 20s, I've always had low estrogen level with peak at 60pg/ml (basically what's expected at the beginning of your cycle) or so. I have lean PCOS and anovulatory

&#x200B;

Recently, I've done a round of egg freezing, and due to the stimulation med, and being PCOS having large number of follicles, my estrogen level kept going up (all the way to 12000pg/ml!) as follicles started to grow.  

The egg stimulation phase is supposed to be somewhat uncomfortable time for a lot of people, with bloating, and other side effects.

but I really felt a boost in my energy level and boost during the period, pretty immediately, after i started injecting follicle growth hormones. 

&#x200B;

I saw myself easily smiling, being anxious about thing way less, less brain fog, being able to focus, remain calm, lots of energy....

Egg Freezing/Retrieval is very involved/expensive and invasive procedure, so I'm not encouraging anyone to do this just for this hormonal experience, but I wanted to share my anecdote/finding. Please share if you have any similar experience/finding.

After the egg retrieval, and some recovery time, I'm my estrogen level is back to where it was, and my restlessness/anxiousness came back.
