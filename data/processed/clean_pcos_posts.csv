This has turned into a weight loss sub,"i joined thus sub for support and info on pcos, but i feel i will be leaving soon. i understand weightbody image struggle is something many of us experience and how someone else feels about their body is their own business, not mine. but theres always a but i feel like nearly every post turns to the topic of weight loss and how hard it is. i am now coming across posts of people with healthy bmis posting about how they hate their bodies and how fat they feel. again, not trying to police anyones experiences, but i am in ed recovery and seeing weights lower than mine called disgusting is not where i need to be. since the responsibility for viewing my own triggers is on me, i will be taking my leave. i wish you all the best, and i do not wish to attack anyone, just share and hopefully start a healthy and respectful discussion.",/r/PCOS/comments/th1l25/this_has_turned_into_a_weight_loss_sub/,565
I'm now free of the curse,"my pcos evolved into ovarian cancer and after months of chemo my end of treatment on wednesday was a full hysterectomy. im on hrt now and already feeling the effects. including the immediate stop of one of my least favourite pcos symptoms, hot flashes. the random sweating has been the bane of my existence since puberty. i havent had a single hot flash since yesterday, only chills coming from cold, winter air, and any hot from the efficiency of my heater and warmth of my blankets. recovery from the surgery is painful, but manageable with tylenol. now to heal and wait to hear back from the doctors to see if the pathology results are clear. fortunately, im on bc disability, so most of my prescriptions get covered, and im happy to say that hrt is one of them",/r/PCOS/comments/1gt865p/im_now_free_of_the_curse/,546
TIL we are at higher risk of vit D deficiency AND it affects us more.,"i am very sore and i was looking up reasons btw we are also more prone to soreness bc of an insane amount of reasons too lol and found the link between vit d and pcos. went down the rabbit hole but basically its harder for us research suggests that up to 7085 of people with pcos are deficient in vitamin d, even if they live in sunny climates. pcos can impair vitamin d metabolism due to chronic inflammation and insulin resistance, making it harder to absorb and utilize effectively. but also more important deficiency in vitamin d can worsen the key symptoms of pcos, including a insulin sensitivity elevated blood sugar levels, fat storage, and worsened androgen imbalances, even in lean individuals vitamin d enhances the activity of insulin receptors, improving glucose uptake and reducing insulin resistance. b androgen levels acne, hirsutism, and hair loss vitamin d regulates androgen production by reducing luteinizing hormone lh levels, which are often elevated in pcos. c inflammation worsens other pcos symptoms, impairs recovery from exercise and increases risk of heart disease vitamin d has antiinflammatory properties and may reduce markers of inflammation like creactive protein crp. d weight management hormonal and metabolic imbalances adequate vitamin d levels may improve fat metabolism and appetite regulation, aiding in weight management. e menstrual cycles irregular or absent periods, ovulation issues vitamin d supports healthy ovulation and progesterone production, helping regulate cycles. f mental health pcos is often associated with anxiety and depression, potentially worsened by vitamin d deficiency, which plays a role in serotonin production and mood regulation. every day i learn something new about pcos and i hate it. thanks for coming to my ted talk. edit ways to get enough are obviously thorugh supplementation but also enough sunlight i just got one of those lamps and i was already noticing benefits!, avoiding calcium overload guilty and magnesium supplementation!",/r/PCOS/comments/1h4onae/til_we_are_at_higher_risk_of_vit_d_deficiency_and/,294

"I'm down 5 pounds in a month and I don't feel hungry, I don't starve myself, and I'm so happy with it.","i know that people want to see weight loss much higher than 1lb a week. but i also knew that with pcos, recovery from an eating disorder and being my first weight loss journey, that this could be a really difficult battle. not to mention, im 53, my 500 cal deficit is only 1300, and any less i would worry about deficiencies. i was so worried i wouldnt lose any weight at all because of everyones struggle i hear about here. for a month the scale didnt budge, and i was starting to lose hope until a week after that point when i dropped 2, then 5 pounds total. i know its not much, but it means im actually losing at a normal rate, and i definitely have insulin resistance, my doctors told me, and i was getting terrible symptoms from eating carbs or sugar before my diet change. it turns out, sugar stays in your system for 3 months, so i had 3 months of high sugar backed up in my system, so any more made me feel ill. i was constantly hungry and constantly having sugar cravings, i was well on my way to diabetes. this is why i had to make the change. what i did just a regular, 500 cal deficit. anymore could have led to high cortisol, slow metabolism and deficiency intermittent fasting to help lower insulin and help me to feel full and still be able to have voluminous meals 168 low sugar, low carb diet without totally restricting these, i didnt cut out any foods, just lowered them, but a small sugar fast helped lower my overall blood sugar levels so now i can eat sugar without feeling sick i balance my meals. i have less carbs, but i always make sure to include healthy fats and protein in good amounts. this makes sure my meal is satisfying and delicious. delicious food is absolutely a key here. no high intensity cardio, just finding every excuse to walk every day. no more grocery delivery, i walk and get it in person whenever i run out instead of all at once. resistance training 3x a week, unless i am too fatigued in which case i trust my body. a strong green tea for caffeine, every morning. unless im specifically resting. this helps me to be more active, get more done, without feeling jittery and stressed. i dont take any supplements. i simply cant afford it and i dont plan to start. i have taken actual liquid acv in the past but it was too gross to keep drinking. i do believe all of these things helped. and it didnt feel like doing too much. i got used to each of them. intermittent fasting comes naturally now and helps me personally so much to meet my calorie goal, just because of the way i work as a person. i no longer experience symptoms from eating sugarcarbs, i no longer crave them but will eat sugar sometimes and carbs in moderation. i was tested for diabetes and it was negative, by the way i have energy all day. i rest when i need it. i have refeed days up to maintenence when i feel i need it. i dont have cheat meals because i dont need them. ive met my calorie goal every day and i never feel like im starving. im more full than before. edit personally intermittent fasting actually matches really well with my inner cycle of when i naturally want to eat food. it makes me much less stressed, it was hard for me to need to eat food all through the day. and calorie counting is to help me eat enough, not just too much! i am just happy that i am able to lose weight at a normal rate without unsustainable changes and i want people to see that it isnt a weight loss death sentence if you have pcos. i believe that taking an approach where i find my diet quite easy to stick to, it doesnt feel like a chore, i enjoy the foods and dont eat at a crazy deficit, this means my cortisol doesnt go high or might even be lowered which i think contributes way more to weight gain than we think. this is just my theory. i dont believe its just luck as my insulin resistance was a real problem previously. i feel much healthier now. im going to continue as i am and hope to see more progress. edit also i forgot to mention! i just got my first regular period. in combination with the combined pill, this is the first period ive had that was consecutive, and not extremely long. i even experience it in a typical way, no pmmd and weird mood stuff.",/r/PCOS/comments/1b7y5ne/im_down_5_pounds_in_a_month_and_i_dont_feel/,154
"I have to choose between a healthy weight & an eating disorder, apparently?","i have struggled for years trying to tell people that i have to eat less than the average person to maintain the same weight, with people very rarely believing me. i gained weight all throughout high school, despite a healthy diet specialized for pcos prescribed by my gynecologist 2 sports at any given time. my first year of college, i was sick of it and kept cutting down more and more. i ended up developing an eating disorder where i was snacking once a day. only then did i begin to lose any weight. i went down from dangerously close to obese to a healthy weight. my mental health absolutely suffered for this. ive been in back forth in recovery for over a year now, and my weight has also fluctuated. recently ive wanted to become stronger, so this morning i checked out the faq on rxxfitness and found this linked study about decreased bmr in people w pcos. in some ways, its a relief to finally see, but right now im just really frustrated. and i know that many people can do omad without disordered thinking, but i cant. i feel like i need to choose between mental physical health. sorry for the longwinded, rambly, negative post. i swear im usually more positive about my pcos diagnosis, but the downer thoughts are the ones that want to get out be heard, yknow? study finding people with pcos have a lower bmr edit turns out a lot of people here have the same exact struggles. while im so sorry because no one should have to face what we do, im really glad that we could start a conversation about it! thank you all so much for your stories, seriously. i have quite a few new perspectives things to try out",/r/PCOS/comments/c58rms/i_have_to_choose_between_a_healthy_weight_an/,153

My 3 year PCOS acne transformation from right before I was diagnosed to now!,"ive been on and off this sub for years reading and relating and now that ive finally figured out my pcos acne i thought maybe i could help someone else or provide a light at the end of the tunnel for anyone else whos starting where i started three years ago. i was diagnosed at 20 after stopping the birth control that i was on since i was 16, i just didnt like how it made me feel. however, that birth control was masking my pcos symptoms, so when i stopped taking it all hell broke loose. i blew up in multiple ways, my weight, my skin, my mood. what finally prompted me to go to the doctor was my period. unlike the common symptom of pcos which is lack of a period, i had my period every other week for 4 months...how my body could bleed that much who knows. after some tests it was confirmed. she started me on a birth control tailored towards pcos, making sure i didnt throw my hormones even more out of wack and the healing began. what i did for my cystic acne i would was with a salicylic acid wash and exfoliant i know sounds brutal but when it was this aggressive and producing new zits every day i needed to have rapid skin turn over i would follow that up with witch hazel soak, helps calm inflammation and redness i would then add on bag balm, a mild antiseptic cream, to calm pustulates even more and prevent bacterial growth and spread of acne i started removing added sugars and grains, and no dairy. after 810 months my skin had calmed a bit but still was more aggressive than your average acne and i still had the trademark hair loss of pcos. thats when i was prescribed spironolactone, this i believe was my game changer. after another six months i was basically acne free, yes i had to rely on medications to get there but ive never felt so great. all that was remaining were acne scars, which i treated by exfoliating, retinol oil, moisturizer and sunscreen! thats where i am today, a long road to skin recovery and restoration of my selfesteem. every step was worth it. i get zits here and there and it brings me joy seeing them as normal blemishes most girls face and not the cystic mounds i was use to. hopefully my story to recovery can provide some hope that those nights of frustration and constantly trying to better your symptoms are worth it. i still suffer from other aspects of pcos like the insulin sensitivity, hair growthhair loss, but im sure with time those will come around! picture was on what i thought was a good day for my acne, couldnt bare taking pictures on the regular days.",/r/PCOS/comments/d91zi5/my_3_year_pcos_acne_transformation_from_right/,142
Eating disorder and PCOS: Relapse appears inevitable,"no clear objective by writing this post. mostly just trying to process, and wondering if anyone feels the same and could offer empathy. im looking at a likely diagnosis of pcos. i dont fit the standard for a pcos candidate i am normal weight, but ill have anywhere from like 40 to 65 days between periods, my blood tests revealed elevated dheas, im on the higher end of normal for afc, and my testosterone was right on the very edge of normal. i recently had a pelvic ultrasound conducted and im still waiting on my doctors interpretation of the results. this is where it gets complicated. i am 6 years recovered from a very aggressive eating disorder that nearly cost me my life. the recovery was very long, and grueling, but i have found so much relief and mental stability in my treatment plan i.e. not restricting any types of foods, eating three meals a day, incorporating all food groups, no fasting, no restricting etc. now contrast that with the standard pcos treatment, particularly for diet changes regarding the insulin resistance part. seems like a guaranteed setup for failure for someone with body image and eating issues. the potential symptoms of pcos can ravage any womans self esteem, with or without the presence of an ed. with these beauty standards of an effortlessly thin body, a full, luxurious head of hair, and this super obnoxious and outdated, yet somehow still prevalent idea of femininity, it seems like such a cruel joke. as result, i am experiencing quite a bit of fear and uncertainty. pcos could possibly undermine all of my workmy mental health, as well as my sense of safety, predictability and control. i dont know what to do and it feels like i cant win. is anyone else going through something like this right now? how have you managed? what have you been feeling? tldr pcos treatment seems to be fundamentally incompatible with the mental health of someone with a history of of eating disorders and body image issues. update 313 had ultrasound and fasting glucose test done. the ultrasound, irregular periods, and elevated androgen levels confirmed the pcos diagnosis. my fasting glucose level was 80. the doctor suggested birth control, which i vehemently declined due to my dibilitating fear of weight gain and increased emotional instability, so were starting with metformin extended release. ive been on it for about 6 or 7 weeks now, starting at 500 mg and trying to work up to 1500 mg. i got my period about two weeks after starting it, which was a relief since i had gone 60 days without it. its too early to tell if its making me regular, so well have to wait and see.",/r/PCOS/comments/18vh6fr/eating_disorder_and_pcos_relapse_appears/,132
"After 10 years on Metformin, I'm told I don't actually have PCOS","as the title says. 2012 was an extremely stressful year for me with us immigration. by dec 2012, i had gained weight and i missed 1 period. i was told that my insulin was high, i had some hirsutism and that i had pcos. no imaging studies or ultrasound, just a male endocrinologist and one lab draw. i was immediately put on the highest dose of 2000mg metformin which i had to take 4 times a day at 500mg because the 1000mg pill was too harsh on my stomach. the past few years have been increasingly hard for me to manage my condition despite researching so much about the condition. the pcos diet wasnt working, master cleanse for 30 days would give me 23 months relief from gi and weight issues, the supplements barely helped trust me, i have tried every herb and supplement listed in research to help with pcos . i tried spirolactone with no success. my hirsutism was always limited to 24 bumps along the sides of my jawline and left side of my chin. a few supplements for inflammation helped any acne glutathione. i was increasingly sensitive to every type of food and tried histamine intolerance diet. i saw an allergistimmunologist very allergic to pine barkpycnogenol, gi specialist, female endocrinologist, reproductive specialist. i even had a colonoscopyendoscopy and workup for celiac disease negative but some wheat intolerance. my sister paid for food sensitivities testing, and i adjusted my diet turns out my 12 sensitivities were carrots and horseradish...odd, but good info. i was still having post prandial extreme bloating and started to feel sick in the mornings and i couldnt get out of bed. i tried antidepressants, but i kept feeling like it was an organicphysical depression. i gained 60lbs in 6 months. i couldnt sleep, my long time insomnia got worse and worse. i started to experience eyelid swelling, centripetal obesity, moon face. i suspected adrenal insufficiency and started to take melatonin and vitamin d as a remedy for histamine intolerance with this i could sleep 23 hrs max. i felt like i was swelling up like violet in willy wonka. i tried to see my endocrinologist but after a few years of no success and insurance rejecting ozempic it seemed like she wanted nothing to do with me. i woke up end of april one morning and my first thought was i feel like im going to die today if i dont get some help. i slowly got myself together, called my mom to come with me and finally went to urgent care with her because of my eyelid swelling. i didnt know what else to do. a doctor there who usually works emergency looked at me and suggested a differential diagnosis of cushings syndrome. he said he felt helpless because he couldnt do the workup he wanted at urgent care but he listened to me. i cried. my testosterone had always tested normal and my amh was slightly better than ideal for my age i started my fertility consultation in the fall. cushings made perfect sense. i got an ambulatory referral from him to endocrinology and a new list of specialists. i saw one 2 days later. i changed my diet and supplement routine to cushingscortisol diet and finally no bloating, constipation and my energy returned. i finally lost weight naturally without resorting to extreme methods. i started drinking carbonated water after watching a dr. berg video on it and it had potassium chloride and i had extreme diuresis for 23 days and puffiness went away. i looked in the mirror and for the first time i didnt have any eye bags. cortisol creates metabolic alkalosis and edema where sodium goes, water follows so sodiumfree carbonated water has helped so much in balancing out the edema. cortisol itself raises histamine which vitamin d and melatonin block, but cortisol releasing hormone is an antihistamine so it becomes a feedback loop as the body raises crh to lower histamine. increasing my calcium fresh cheese only ricotta and potassium intake has helped as well. pomegranate, garlic, horsetail, and stinging nettle too. i have a list, and i have started to slowly reintegrate some foods. i no longer struggle to process gluten or have histamine responses to food. my sleep is slowly improving. now that i know the signs of the cortisol spikes eyelid edema is an lesser known sign, insomnia etc i can manage it better. my hirsutism has gone away still some scars from the repeated inflammation but they are totally flat not one inflamed follicle. i can tell that my left adrenal was worse because thats the side where i had the most hirsutism and eyelid swelling. my hair has grown back i was having androgenic alopecia and had 23 bald spots mostly on the left side as well. since then, ive had a pelvic abdominal ct, more extensive lab work finally done, and transvaginal ultrasound. i was cleared of pcos this morning by my new primary care doctor who is amazing and oldschool. he told me that i will taper off metformin for the next month or two i had already kind of started to not take it and that 10 years of hypoglycemic episodes from the medication likely caused my adrenals to finally quit and protest which is why cortisol took over and it looks like cushings my body was and is sensitive to stress. im still getting some additional testing to rule out sleep issues. i feel like i finally have my life back. misdiagnosis sucks and im still obviously processing everything. i desperately want to lose this weight ive gained but im trying to be compassionate towards myself healing is not linear and recovery will take time. i know theres a bigger reason to why my path was so hard. i will still hang around and try to offer tips where i can as the androgenic aspect of stresses out adrenal glands was the same as having pcos. cushingscortisoldominance and pcosestrogendominance are hard to differentiate and i am still working through the nuances but ive found some things that work. hopefully this storyvent will help you think carefully about your symptoms and empower you to keep pushing forward until you experience the relief and medical responsiveness we all deserve. tldr misdiagnosed with pcos. if you take anything from this, please let it be the following 1. get a second medical opinion. 2. listen to your body, if nothing is working it may be a sign too. it doesnt always mean youre failing to manage your health. dont internalize it that way. 3. doctors are not gods. they dont like to feel helpless but admitting that they dont know the answers may be the first step towards getting healthy only stick with one that looks you in the eyes and listens. 4. dont quit. it took me finding a thousand ways that didnt work before landing on misdiagnosis but the knowledge ive gained from research i hope to help others with someday i am in my phd but decided i definitely want to finish my md that i started as welltransfer to that program.",/r/PCOS/comments/13xcrxn/after_10_years_on_metformin_im_told_i_dont/,133
Diet Intervention/Change ≠ Diet Culture,"this messaging that somehow choosing to restrict certain foods from your diet is participating in diet culture or disordered eating seems to be growing more popular within pcos treatmentnutrition spaces. raise your hand if you feel personally victimized by this sentiment i know quite a few of you do, as i briefly mentioned this issue at the end of a post i wrote yesterday and you all commented feeling the same. since so many people resonated with that part of the post i decided to make a seperate post to discuss this ideology and why it can be very toxic to spread. i wish certain influencersdietitiansnutritionists especially those active on social media would stop labeling restricting certain foods from your diet as diet culture or disordered eating. im so sick of hearing this idea that if people dont eat any and everything they have a taste for theyre somehow disordered, participating in diet culture or both. insisting that the only way for someone to not be disordered and not be an active in diet culture is by learning how to intuitively eat any and everything they like the taste of, regardless of how it affects their symptoms is harmful period. i like the taste of oreos. im also aware that regularover consumption of oreos causes me extreme dysmenorrheic pain. im also aware that i am unable to control my oreo intake, resulting in incessantover consumption. theres no such thing as just a few of those bad boys for me, or once in a while. theres no intuitively eating such a high palatable processed food without harm for me. so yes, i choose to restrict dun dun dun them from my diet to avoid the dysmenorrheic pain. if anything, choosing to eat oreos knowing that i can barely control my intake with them, and knowing what happens to me when i eat them is what disordered eating looks like for me. i do not have orthorexia, i have pcos and after 7 years of diagnosis i know certain foods make my symptoms exponentially worse, and therefore i choose to avoid them. people are not disordered for restricting certain foods or whole entire food groups, yes, food groups! they know dont agree with them. you wouldnt call someone whos lactose intolerant disordered for avoiding dairy, you wouldnt call someone diagnosed with t2d disordered for avoiding sugary foods, so why call people with pcos who know they cant handle carbs, sugar, fruits, fried foods, processed foods, dairy, soy or whatever else they have taken note of that makes their symptoms worse disordered for choosing not to eat them? whether we like those foods or not is immaterial. knowing those foods cause us harm thru personal experience is a good enough reason to avoid them. labeling every little change to diet as faddisordereddiet culture will soon result in those words becoming meaningless. its mindboggling to me that people who claim to specialize in nutrition for pcos would label any and every type of restriction as disorderdiet culture. i can understand why this would be the sentiment in generalized nutritioned recoveryintuitive eating spaces, because in those spaces its not assumed that the majority have metabolic disorders and that certain foods are avoided not because of negative reactions to those foods but because of stigma or fear. but for those of us who have been living with metabolic disorders, and have taken note of what foods cause us harm, of what benefit is it to tell us that were disordered for avoiding them? or for not learning how to intuitively eat them? i put ie in quotes because i honestly believe the method of eating being passed off as ie by certain people in certain spaces is actually a misappropriation of ie. none, in my opinion. so please stop. edit just a quick disclaimer, i do not believe people who choose not to restrict certain foods from their diet are wrong in their approach to pcos treatment regardless of whether those foods negatively affect their symptoms or not. i just believe that those of us who do choose to restrict certain foods from our diet when we know they negatively affect us from personal experiences shouldnt be labeled as disordered or participating in diet culture. thats my main spiel",/r/PCOS/comments/11onax8/diet_interventionchange_diet_culture/,118
Fixing my sleep helped me manage PCOS symptoms and bring my blood sugar back to normal,"i have pcos and, like a lot of people here, i struggled with low energy, mood swings, irregular cycles, and that constant wired but tired feeling especially in the afternoons. my doctor told me to exercise more and eat better which i was already doing, but nothing really changed. then, i started looking into sleep and recovery something i had been ignoring. i got a wearable and started tracking everything. turns out i was averaging just 5 hours of sleep per night, fragmented and inconsistent. i hadnt realized how much that was messing with my hormones, insulin resistance, and mental clarity. heres what i changed that made a huge difference started taking my multivitamins in the afternoon, especially magnesium it was disrupting my rem sleep at night cut caffeine after 3pm ate bloodsugarfriendly dinners more proteinfiber, fewer carbs shut off overhead lights 2 hours before bed stuck to a regular sleepwake schedule, even on weekends game changer for my cycle regularity after a few weeks, i noticed improvements in my energy, mood, and sleep quality. a couple months later, my blood sugar stabilized, and for the first time in ages, i felt like i had a predictable routine. im now building a tool with my partner that helps people with conditions like pcos use their own data to create better daily habits across sleep, stress, movement, and food. its designed to be more personalized than the generic stuff most apps give. if this sounds like something youd want to try, were opening early access soon. would love feedback from others managing pcos too what has helped you the most in managing fatigue or sugar crashes with pcos?",/r/PCOS/comments/1jx5gcu/fixing_my_sleep_helped_me_manage_pcos_symptoms/,106

Working on my eating disorder recovery has helped my PCOS - without restriction or low carb,"hey everyone, i started showing pcos symptoms when i gained more and more weight due to my eating disorder and since the pcos onset late 2017, ive had only two or three natural periods. i was also diagnosed with insulin resistance. the diagnoses really worsened my ed and depression. i was constantly trying to restrict, only to end up ordering pizza and eating ice cream and other high carb foods that i labelled as bad and forbidden. the prospect of being forced to restrict a food group to help my pcos symptoms felt like having to pick between physical health and mental health. this summer, i went back to ed treatment and began following the meal plan. all meals contain all food groups. i thought it would never work and even make my pcos worse... ...so imagine my surprise when i started my first natural period in over 8 months after 5 weeks of eating balanced meals. the only thing that changed significantly is my diet. i made this post to encourage everyone struggling with an eating disorder of any kind who feels the way i did about following a pcos diet to seek help and establish some semblance of a balanced diet before resorting to restricting carbs. it may not work for everyone, but its worth a try and a good starting point..",/r/PCOS/comments/d0f33t/working_on_my_eating_disorder_recovery_has_helped/,68
General advice/info from PCOS symposium,"i recently watched most of the presentations from day 1 and day 2 of the recent pcos challenge symposium and thought i would provide a general summary of the advice given. hopefully this is ok to do! btw you can still buy tickets and watch recordings of each presentation for yourself, there are also several qa sessions and panels that i didnt watch all of, so i highly recommend checking it out if you can. i think the recordings are available for 30 days from the day of the symposium so day 2 recordings of the symposium are available until 19th october. day 1 of the symposium covered fertility stuff that may also interest you but imo a lot of the takeaways was similar to the lifestyle stuff on day 2. i didnt watch any of day 3 which i think was largely around adolescent health. fyi you need to buy a separate 40 ticket for each day that you are interested in. for most people, that would probably be day 2. there was also a lot of explanation about the various aspects of pcos, how cycles and the endocrinereproductive systems work and what is happening when pcos is involved etc, i wont go into any of that here but will answer any questions as best as i can. note that the advice and information given was very general, and may not apply to your specific situation. i took notes but also relying on memory for some of this so it may not all be 100 accurate. diagnosis the rotterdam criteria is generally the most accepted criteria for diagnosing pcos. weight the fat shaming or just lose weight approach that many doctors take is not helpful and you should avoid these doctors. while losing weight can help with pcos, it is better to make it about optimizing for health rather than focusing on the number on the scale. i was less focused on the weight aspect so i hope ive managed to convey the general attitude about weight reasonably well apologies if i havent. diet most speakers did not advocate for any one particular diet. instead, think about what you can add to your diet, rather than restrict, and keep it sustainable for the long term! general guidelines for whathow you should eat aim for half of your meal to be fruits and veges, a quarter protein and a quarter low gi carbs, and a small amount of healthy fats. get plenty of fiber 25g per day! there is no particular reason to avoid dairy, gluten or soy, unless you do feel better without them caveat one doctor on day 1 did say that their studies showed that dairy can worsen things but did not elaborate further aim for unprocessed foods as much as possible plant based whole foods is best! note this doesnt specifically exclude meatanimal products increase antiinflammatory foods green tea, nutsseeds, vegesfruits, omega 3, flaxseed, fermented foods containing live active cultures preprobiotics, e.g. kombucha, kimchi, pickles, yoghurt, fermented soy decrease inflammatory foods sugary drinksfoods, refined carbs, processed meat, friedcharred foods, excess omega 6 timing of your meals try to eat around the same time each day eat fewer, larger meals limit snacking have dinner and next day breakfast 13 hours apart intermittent fasting eat more of your calories earlier in the day. studies show that eating half of your daily calories at breakfast led to lower androgeninsulin levels edit to add another recommendation was if you have a glucose monitor, using that to see what spikes your blood sugar so you know what foods to personally avoid since something that spikes one person might not spike another. also can use it to see the effects of foods you eat in combination e.g. carbs with a protein, carbs with a fat etc. exercise the bottom line any exercise you can do is good! it lowers androgens and increases insulin sensitivity. there is no bad exercise for pcos however doing too much may be detrimental. aim for a minimum of 120 minutes of vigorous exercise per week try not to do more than 60 minutes in any one day this is where it may get detrimental, but if youre an athlete doing more than this then you may need help to optimize your recovery if you had to pick only one type of exercise, strength training is meant to be the best as it increases your lean muscle mass and this is great for pcos because it makes your body so much better at using energy and regulating everything. do upper body push, upper body pull, core, and leg exercises, increasing progressively. but anything that you can do and keep up is great try to do something light on your rest days like a walk or a short, light yoga session yoga is also good for pcos and there are a few studies that show this hiit was also discussed and said to be great exercise too. recommendation was max 20 mins at a time, with alternating short periods of high intensity and low intensity exercise, e.g. 30 seconds high intensity then 30 seconds low intensity. meds there was some discussion of metformin including vs inositol, but spiro and bc were generally only mentioned in passing. metformin may be helpful but not necessarily for everyone, and inositol may be as good as metformin but without the side effects personal note i dont think inositol is entirely without side effects. bc has its place but too many doctors throw bc at patients and say come back when you want to get pregnant. supplements supplements were discussed in various presentations. i will just give a list of some of the supplements discussed inositol, berberine, nac, melatonin, vitamin d, omega 3, zinc, coq10, probiotics, white peony, licorice, egcg?, saw palmetto, spearmint, pygeum bark. obviously its not recommended to take all of these, just some supplements that might be recommendedbeneficial depending on your specific situation. for inositol, 401 myodchiro inositol is best make sure you take any supplements correctly with a meal, at specific time etc check for fillers in supplements make sure that they have been certified by one of two organisations for those us based since supplements are unregulated other lifestyle factors stay hydrated! manage stress and emotionalmental health. therapy, meditation etc. from memory, the insights timer app was recommended for meditation but anything you find and use to get started is good. the pcos psychologist talked about various issues you might face, including depression, anxiety, angerirritability, eating problems, relationshipsexual problems etc. ensure adequate sleep. try to have a consistent routine with sleeping and eating to try and get your body to fall into a natural circadian rhythm. if you keep waking up feeling unrefreshed after 8 hours sleep, consider looking into sleep apnea. blood tests there was a talk on blood tests for pcos. in summary, reference ranges are set by labs using the distribution of samples from within the population. this means that your results can be normal falls within the range found in 95 of the normal population but can still be too lowhigh. examples given the range for testosterone may be approximately 1476 depending on the lab, but anything over 45 would be indicative of pcos. similarly with dheas the range would be approximately 44425 but in pcos you would often see values over 200. be a detective in figuring out what works for you, make a plan, and make one or two small changes at a time, to help build better habits that stick for the long term its a marathon, not a sprint!",/r/PCOS/comments/j6sk7d/general_adviceinfo_from_pcos_symposium/,64
I GOT MY PERIOD TODAY,"after not getting my period for two years, i finally got my period today and im crying tears of joy . ive spent sooo much time trying to correct my hormonesdeal with pcos symptoms and i feel like ive finally done something right. ive seen so many doctors and tried so many different supplementsdiets and i think there are a few things that finally got my body on the right track! first, i added two supplements into my routine with the specific purpose of addressing the insulin resistance that seems to be at the core of pcos amla tea taken in the morning before any food berberine hcl a capsule taken at each meal these were the most recent addition to my routine, so i suspect they have been pretty important! other things that i think played a role ovasitol i started taking it two months ago so im not 100 sure that it has helped but ive read that it can take months to start working and its one of the few things ive been really consistent with so i think it likely played a big role. essential oils ive been using two blends by yl, endoflex applied daily to the skin over the thyroid and progessence applied daily to the inside of the forearm. i know that essential oils are hotly debated and i honestly didnt have any faith in themmy mom gave them to me and i figured i didnt have anything to lose. i liked the scent so i have been using them religiously for about two months. diet i have tried everythingggg and i really dont think that anything made a difference. ive tried hclf, keto, high protein, you name it and ive tried it note, i did all this as a vegan who is allergic to gluten. however!! i read a study about soy having a positive effect on hormonal balance so for the past month i have been eating soy every day, sometimes multiple times a day. so i think this definitely could have been a contributing factor! weight during these two years my weight has steadily risen about twenty pounds even though i was eating the same amount of calories. it didnt bother me too much at first but over the past month i decided to eat in a modest deficient to see if i could lose a few. in the time i have lost about five pounds, but i dont think it played any role in regaining my period. exercise ive always been pretty active but i think that changing my activity style has been really important. i used to do a lot of hiit and i completely cut that, switching to walking between 10k20k steps per day. i think that this was important for me because my pcos was likely caused by an extended period of high stress college and relationship drama all at once, and for a couple of years. so i think that giving my body a bit of a break was really important. pcos is a beast its absolutely exhausting and so expensive to manage as i know all of my sisters here are familiar with. its consumed so much of my life for so long so i really really hope that this period is the start of a longterm recovery for lack of a better word haha. i wanted to share a bit of my journey in hopes that maybe some of it will be helpful for someone else!! love you all the support that we share here has been and im sure will continue to be so essential for my mental wellbeing and im thankful for each of you we can do it girls!!",/r/PCOS/comments/hufbl8/i_got_my_period_today/,56
Help me understand what my girlfriend is going through?,"hello! ive been dating this amazing chick for three months, now. she told me early on that she has pcos. she explained it to me, and i mostly understand. she has other worries, some being that kidney disease and cystic kidneys run on both sides of her family her father passed away from a stroke during recovery from a kidney transplant and apparently pcos can increase your odds of kidney related illnesses. ive googled pcos in an effort to learn more, but its all textbook stuff, and i want to learn about it from people actually living with this. im curious about how it effects cramps and pms? she says it doesnt change either, but she seems to be in more pain than any other woman ive known when going through their period. i know every woman doesnt feel symptoms the same, but i want to make sure i can help know what to do. she says that keto diets can help with some of the symptoms. can anyone help me understand this? ive never tried keto, but if it can make her life a little easier, id give it a shot. i know what it feels like to try dieting alone, and im positive her eating habits have declined since meeting me im the bad influence, here. she says it effects her hormones. she has thinner hair, and some facial hair. it doesnt bother me at all. how else does this effect ones hormones and body? does pcos cause pain in general? can it cause head aches? she says it makes her back hurt. is there a massage i can do to help relieve some of that? ive casually asked her some of these questions, or shes brought it up on her own. i dont want her to feel like im grilling her or having second thoughts about us, so i thought id ask yall. thanks in advance!",/r/PCOS/comments/evsw3e/help_me_understand_what_my_girlfriend_is_going/,47

dieting is triggering?,"content warning body talk eating disorders dieting hey all!! i have a question about eating disorder recovery and body image issues, if anyone could share some adviceperspective for me! so i struggled with anorexia nervosa for a couple years as a 1415 year old, but no longer do, and actually gained a significant amount of weight during my senior year of high school 2020! amidst the pandemic, leaving an abusive environment, healing my inner child, and feeling food freedom for the first time in a while. my doctor is an angel and knows my past with this, and makes sure to never trigger me, but the fact of the matter is that according to science, i am overweight and need to lose a lot. i also have pcos, and so managing my sugar intakecarb intake is important for my insulin resistance issues, and is being monitored closely by my doctor. sooo, thats all to say, that i am trying to eat more whole foods, less refined sugars, more fruitsveggies, less carbs, less fast food to try to lose the weight and also keep my blood sugar levels in check. my issue, though, is that it is kinda triggering and demoralizing to be watching my sugar intake reading nutrition labels for cerealscoffee creamers in the store to see the sugarcarb content forcing myself to eat spinach or other greens when i just would rather have taco bell as a soure of comfort food i am also going through a horrible breakup currently. sorry i am rambling. basically, i am wondering if any of you in eating disorder recovery or who struggledstruggle with body image and body dysmorphia handle dieting, or managing your weight or other health issues that your doctor wants you to keep track of. how do you not feel constantly triggered? how do you enjoy eating the stuff that your body needs most, without feeling like youre punishing yourselfreverting back to your ed tendencies?? thank you so much",/r/PCOS/comments/141ffdr/dieting_is_triggering/,38

Today I was reminded how dismissive doctors can be,"i joined this subreddit about a year ago as i was at my lowestlow and was continually met with doctors who dismissed me and that something was wrong between unexplained weight gain, excessive fatigue and brain fog, and brutal periods post a 16 year run on birth control. i looked to this group for advice, which helped tremendously, but i still wanted more. it was july 2022 when i was officially diagnosed, but not by a traditional doctor, but a nutritionist who read my bloodwork a previous endo had offered, and of course dismissed, and identified the insulin resistance and high cortisol levels that others had told me were textbook within range. since then, and by following her recommendations of changes to diet and exercise, i was able to lose 25 pounds and regain quality of life almost immediately. the insulin component had frightened me, so i did decide to try mounjaro which a telehealth provider had prescribed off of same bloodwork and over the course of 11 months i have lost 75 pounds between lifestyle changes which i am quite strict with and medication. i decided to try a traditional endo again today for the sake of getting updated bloodwork. the entire appointment, i was reminded, but not shocked, at how dismissive traditional doctors can be. she told me i didnt look like i had pcos i do not have acne or excess facial hair, and that i was just obese. by standards, i am i am 58 and currently 192 pounds however i have a naturally bigger frame and my workouts are generally low impact with heavy lifting so i do hold a lot of muscle mass. she also stated because my periods are currently normal which i explained they only recently became as such, i must not have pcos. she also said because i dont actually have cysts, it cant be and that insulin resistance isnt real. she then proceeded to read the previous bloodwork from a year ago, and told me that everything was medical standards within range and reiterated that i was just overweight. she didnt feel the need to explore bloodwork further. she also claimed that it seemed maybe the whole reason i went on mounjaro to begin with is just because i was actually just overweight. i responded to her with that this was not the first time i had been dismissed by doctors, and weight loss aside, my journey over the past year has proven a better quality of life. i am no longer constantly fatigued, i dont feel like i am in fight or flight mode everyday, i have a normal period, and i have lowered my blood pressure as well as my resting heart rate. i also asked, why wouldnt i want to see updated bloodwork? isnt the end goal to see improvements, regardless of where i fall within the ranges? she was not happy. i should also call out that when i noted how i think ovasitol has been crucial in helping me, she rolled her eyes and laughed. thankfully, i am currently in a much better headspace than i was a year ago and i took it for what it was worth, but i left feeling disappointed not really for myself but for all the others who are dealing with dismissive doctors. i have been there, and it reminded me of how long it actually took for me to get real answers and help. its disappointing because we are supposed to be able to rely on medical professionals for help, but more times than not we are continually dismissed. i know the runaround that i had for years trying to figure out what was wrong with me, and how defeated i felt. it almost seems as though doctors sometimes want to keep you sick and are not supportive of the road to recovery or better management of pcos. this is not to knock all endos and traditional doctors as i am sure some are great, but in my experience, and from what i have heard from many others struggling to seek help, the medical field needs to do better. i am happy and grateful more than ever i continued to look for answers and found help finally with a nontraditional method and as much as i post this as a rant, i also write it with an empathetic tone above anything else for those who are currently struggling with answers. groups like this are always helpful and supportive to help know you are not alone, but also know there will always be someone out there who listens and helps in my case, a nutritionist. just please keep your head up and know that you know your body better than anyone. you got this.",/r/PCOS/comments/14e1god/today_i_was_reminded_how_dismissive_doctors_can_be/,28

"finally at peace with eating disorder, gutted by PCOS diagnosis","you can probably extrapolate based on the title. ive spent most of my life consumed by an undiagnosed eating disorder. i never received treatment because in my family you could never be too skinny i come from orthorexic, crunchy stock. i wasted my adolescence consumed by my disordered eating, going through cycles of purging and intense restriction and then gaining the weight back. repeat ad nauseum. i am in my midlate twenties now and have put so much time and energy toward repairing my relationship with food. i have had to diy this recovery shit. i feel like ive only just now arrived at a point in my life where i could accept that there were no inherently bad foods and i had began to eat intuitively. my weight has stabilized. i am of an average build, not overweight, and my only symptoms were irregular periods and hormonal acne, but my doctor ran blood tests just in case. hormone ratios came back indicative of pcos, which means i meet diagnostic criteria. ive booked a followup appointment and i suspect well be checking for insulin resistance next. there is some diabetes and prediabetes in my family so i think i know where this is going. ive been going down the rabbit hole of what this means for me and i am devastated. i have finally taken myself off a lifelong restrictive diet and i will now likely be asked to adopt another restrictive diet. i am poor and i live in the us so the odds of me seeing a dietician are slim. i feel like i cant handle this. can anyone please offer me some reassurance or at least similar experiences? all i can see right now is a return to a life where i am so fixated on food that i cannot maintain normal relationships with people. i have a lifetime of anecdotal evidence to show that as long as i am micromanaging my diet, i can never know peace. i finally got a taste of normal life. i can cook for my girlfriend, i can eat meals with friends. i know i sound melodramatic right now but im so scared to go back",/r/PCOS/comments/zq1wnj/finally_at_peace_with_eating_disorder_gutted_by/,25
General Health and Weight Loss Tips and Advice!,"ive noticed a lot of people ask for weight loss advice so just wanted to share some tips that have worked for me. its a learning process and a whole lifestyle change that im still trying to adapt. ive tried saxenda before i got diagnosed, and i did lose a lot of weight, but as soon as i stopped it, even with staying on the same habits, i gained most of the weight back. after being diagnosed, i spoke to a dietitian and started really looking into how to lose weight with insulin resistance pcos. let me tell you all the advice ive gathered. 1 never skip meals, and make sure to have vegetables at the beginning of every meal, whether it being just some vegetables or a salad. make sure you use nonstarchy vegetables! have 12 fruits a day as a snack between breakfast and lunch, or between lunch and dinner. 2 supplements ive been taking vitamin d, inositol, berberine, magnesium, iron, and im also on glucophage that i take twice a day with lunch and dinner. check your vitamin levels and stay hydrated. 3 the order in which you eat food matters in order to lower blood sugar spikes. for example with carbs, you should have it with protein or right after protein. vegetables first! 4 look into glucosegoddess on instagram, her advice has been helping me, i highly recommend reading her book glucose recovery 5 apple cider vinegar, it tastes terrible but try having it before your main meal, just 1 tbsp with a glass of water could lower your blood sugar spike by around 30 6 exercise, a 10 min walk after your meal reduces insulin spikes. try working out around 5 times a week, even a simple home workout is great! if im doing cardio, i aim to keep my heart rate no higher than zone 2. the reason i mention all this is because with insulin resistance, the more glucose spikes we experience, the more insulin is released from our body. too much insulin is the root cause of obesity and pcos, so doing these things helps flatten our glucose curves, which will flatten our insulin curves. i know it sounds like a lot, and im no medical professional, just things ive learnt from reading and speaking with dieticians. i hope this is helpful but feel free to try whatever you think will work best for you! remember youre not alone, and just always try your best!",/r/PCOS/comments/1d486fy/general_health_and_weight_loss_tips_and_advice/,22
PCOS cyst removal-post surgery thoughts! How I convinced my gyno to send me to surgery + my hospital experience.,"hello lovely ladies! tonight i shall regale you the story of how i convinced my new gyno to send me to surgery finally and how im doing postop because im a little bored and i figured it might help someone. theres part one and part two of this post which will have tldrs for your convenience. part one tldr i explain my gyno history and how i convinced my current gyno to send me to surgery. i had my medical records from 2016 forward and insisted we not medicate or wait and see because we tried that for years and nothing was working. so long story short, since 2016 id been having intermittent but severe abdominal pain. i visited with a gyno and he was the first to diagnose me with pcos. he took a wait and see approach to my care and prescribed me with depoprovera and sent me on my way. the weight gain on that medication was awful. i went back to the doctor and we got into a disagreement that he was doing nothing for my care, that the pain was still there and now i was more overweight than i was before. he refused to do anything else. i left his office with my medical records in hand very important and went to go find another gyno who would take me more seriously. second gyno was a bit more understanding and did a few baseline ultrasounds and transvaginal ultrasounds. she and i went over my results and i asked her, yo, i need surgery to pull these out they hurt! to which she replied, youre too young for surgery. wtf im 28, maam. she said the cysts would resolve on their own and gave me estarylla for birth control. on the bright side, my periods became regular and i stopped having super heavy periods or none at all. i left her office feeling a little disheartened yet hopeful that what she said was true. cue several er visits later, in which they did ultrasounds and ct scans and found more cysts and gasp! a small fibroid! my gyno at the time said, dont worry, the fibroid is small and theres only one. fast forward to present day, wherein my pain was excruciating on the right side and i went to the er after vomiting due to the pain. we ruled out ovarian torsion and my appendix, but the pain persisted. they also found gasp! multiple fibroids! and the one that i had was now bigger. though the er doctor did have an obgyn on call, he refused to call someone for me and send me home with naproxen that didnt even touch the pain. so after a few days of suffering, missing work, and multiple phonecalls to every gyno in the valley, i was finally about to get in that week to be seen. i was able to get records from all of my past gyno appointments of my ultrasounds the ones i didnt already have. heres where things made a difference i handed the new gynos staff, the day before my appointment, all of my medical records and ultrasound reports from 2016 forward. then when i sat down with him, i basically told him that wed done the wait and see approach and lets medicate approach and nothing was resolving. the cyst on the right side had persisted through several years and had not gone away or resolved on its own like it should have. so with my urgent pleading that the doctor send me to surgery, he agreed with all of the evidence that i had presented and we scheduled it for the next week. he even prescribed me tramadol for the pain. what a guy! part two tldr i just had surgery! doing fine. the doctor and i discussed beforehand what he was going to do for me. i followed every step that the hospital gave me to prepare. what my hospital experience was like. some tips for surgery recovery. surgery anticipation, for me, was the worst part. id discussed with my new gyno the risks of the surgery losing my right ovary, possible scarring of my uterus where the fibroids were if he decided to remove them at the time, etc. i was convinced, by my own paranoia, that id lose my right ovary. surgery prep was pretty standard, but there were a few things i had to do. no food or drink after 11pm the night before, wash with antibacterial soap, no lotions or jewelry i even had to take my wedding rigs off the day of surgery. i wore very loose clothes to surgery i even left my bra at home. since i was on my period at the time of surgery, they gave me mesh underwear and a fresh pad to wear. even though im overweight, everything fit fine. no shaving of the area allowed, either this risks infection later dont do it. once i was checked in, the staff got my vitals, followed up with questions about my medication history and any reactions to anesthesia. overall it was actually a pretty pleasant experience. the staff was very kind and the nurse who put my iv in got it on the first try your mileage may vary im a hard stick so this was awesome. the new gyno visited with me before surgery and we discussed, again, what the plan was gonna be. he said hed look at my fibroids but he doubted that hed have to pull them out now because they were still small and he didnt. however the cyst came out without and issue and he was able to preserve my right ovary. huzzah! before surgery, they took me into the or and made me slide from my bed onto the operation table. once i was settled, the anesthesiologist gave me the stuff and i was asleep within a minute. surgery was about 12 hours long. getting out of anesthesia was the hard part. i have asthma so i needed an asthma treatment once i woke up. beyond that, i was just sleepy and groggy but it got better with time. they moved me to my room where i was reunited with my husband. the doctor spoke with my husband to let him know how everything went. once i was in recovery, they made me walk just a little and delivered my pain medications to go home with. walking wasnt too bad the pain medications definitely helped. getting out of the bed required a weird rolling maneuver so that i wasnt doing a direct situp. i got it to work. before id gone to surgery, my husband and i cleaned the house and changed the sheets on our bed. do this. it really helps with healing morale and makes everything easier. husband got me a chocolate shake on our way home and fries. the fries made me a little nauseous at first but better within a few minutes because id had nothing to eat and having something in my stomach was great. the shake really helped and it was tasty. home recovery has involved lots of sleeping with tons of pillows, walking up and down the hallway, more sleeping, sitting up and watching my husband play videogames, eating some soup and more sleeping. im usually not awake at this hour, but my sleep schedule is all whack right now. thats normal. take the stool softener. bearing down will hurt like hell and possibly cause complications. so take the stool softener. you might have a burning sensation with peeing afterwards. thats the anesthesia leaving your body. some people get it. if it persists, talk to your doctor. burp and fart all you want!!!!!! thats the gas that they put into your body if you got a laparoscopic procedure like i did. youll feel less bloated with each time that you do. sore throat? thats normal. its the breathing tube that they put down your throat that causes that. itll go away in a few days. message people on your social media networks to let them know youre okay once youre able to do so. they will worry, believe me! and above all hydrate and dont be afraid to walk. walking helps with recovery. water helps to repair tissues. down time will be anywhere from a 12 weeks. ive got work on monday so thats fun for me.... but ive got an easy desk job and an understanding boss so this should be fine for me. your mileage will vary. as for removing the cyst... i feel great! that might be the painkillers talking right now, but the persistent pain and heaviness is gone. so if you have a surgery coming up, or would like to figure out how to convince your gyno to get you to surgery if needed, feel free to send me a message! best of luck to all of you! im going back to bed.",/r/PCOS/comments/iys060/pcos_cyst_removalpost_surgery_thoughts_how_i/,24
PCOS insomnia is ruining my life. ,"i used to be a full time college student with a part time job, frequent gym goer profesional belly dancer. i was a model citizen doing everything right. the tea is, i could never sleep! i would get two hours every other night. i was exhausted by all normal accounts should be falling asleep as soon as i hit the pillow. it drove me to extremely difficult mental states, even tho my life was perfect. with what i know now, that i have pcos, it was my hormones specifically androgens operating through the roof with my high paced life style. present day, i have been out of college unemployed for a year due to extreme life events. in my recovery, i have slept for the first time in 10 years. without anywhere to be or anything to do, i am stress free and i sleep soundly. i feel like a human for the first time in my adult life. however, obviously that cant last forever. i need to get back into the real world soon. problem is, as soon as i try, my insomnia comes back ten fold. i will be awake for days at a time. but im not awake, im a zombie. i cant get a job because im so sleep deprived that i cant move, let alone drive. once im lucky enough to fall asleep, i will stay asleep. the only problem is i usually cant fall asleep until 4am. sucks when the world wakes up at 6. i want to know does anyone else struggle with this symptom? also, does anyone have a low stress job that allows you to easily manage your pcos? i have a comm degree.",/r/PCOS/comments/1eghuj1/pcos_insomnia_is_ruining_my_life/,21
I keep getting prescribed weight loss and it’s killing me,"so i 24f was diagnosed w pcos last month after a year and a half of advocating. actually the only thing that got me the diagnosis was moving back to the us, and wouldnt you know they did an ultrasound and i was right. basically my period never ends. i might have q day or two here and there but for the most part, its every day. and i passed 3 massive nearly 14 cup clots in 36 hours and i contacted my old gyno for an urgent appointment. for context, i have a meeting w my primary doctor coming up to talk about my adhd meds and my pcos diagnosis, but the first of these massive clots made me decide to call the gyno. i felt like i couldnt leave the house and i gotta start a new job next week lol. so anyways i go in with hope, and i express to the nurse as i always do that im in recovery from an eating disorder to explain why i dont look at the scale and i like to give a heads up that im sensitive about the topic of weight an stuff. so she asks me questions and sets me up, then a doctor ive never had before walks in and immediately goes youre incredibly overweight. not to be rude. but you are very very overweight and that is why youre having this issue and i was like yeah i understand thats a factor but i have experienced this for a long time and ive always been overweight, even when i was a little kid. but im having this immediate problem i need help with keep in mind when my primary scheduled me for a ultrasound, she said there were some medications we could talk about to manage my symptoms right now, and i have made lifestyle changes in the last year which she said would also likely help. back to today, this gyno was just insistent. expressing theres really nothing to do other than me loosing weight. she was like well i can try you on progesterone for now but you just really need to loose weight and im so frustrated bc weight loss is not a prescription. if i broke my leg i would probably be prescribed physical therapy, but also be put in a cast. its both. and i kept expressing this is the severity and i have made lifestyle changes and it hasnt done really anything and she just wouldnt hear it. just kept saying how overweight i am and how the only solution is to loose weight. i experienced this back in the uk where i approached a doctor about a seemingly compromised immune system and the same non stop period, and until i got assigned a doctor that listened to me, i had a npdoctor insisting i had come to her for gastric bypass turns out i was just severely anemic to the point it affected my immune system but i found that out only after seeing a different doctor i just dont know what to do in these situations. im going to go back to my primary and talk to her but jesus. like i get being overweight can lead to issues but i feel like doctors just dont listen to me sometimes. do you all have experiences like this?",/r/PCOS/comments/1k1pt1u/i_keep_getting_prescribed_weight_loss_and_its/,19
Berberine + Inositol is making my periods lighter and less painful,"ive been on it for 2 months, and had two periods since. since i started berberine inositol, my periods have been lighter and less painful. pms symptoms reduced too, though theyre still there for example, shitty insomnia. i was only intending to take them to reduce my blood sugar level and prevent prediabetes from getting worse, but to my pleasant surprise it also helped with reducing constant 247 thirst reducing hunger pangs especially at night or after eating being able to practice portion control without being constantly hungry or getting headaches more energy, more proactive more energy even though i eat less food. its like i can actually use food as fuel now. i am also losing weight, and saving money from eating less food. less acid reflux maybe from eating less thanks to portion control less puffy face in the morning after waking up glowy skin, looks smoother and softer, less dry less pms acne right before period less tension headaches and migraines which often happen during pms or if i havent eaten in a while. before berberine, i would feel shaky and hypoglycemic at the blood sugar level of.... 100. now i feel perfectly fine in the 80s. surprisingly less sore after exercises and faster recovery, and i feel like i can do more reps, push further, and run longer. probably because my muscles can actually use glucose as fuel now. so it means a lot of the pcos and gynorelated symptoms ive been having was related to either high blood sugar or insulin resistance, and berberine inositol has been helping with that. i am thinking of trying metformin as well to see if it helps my pcos and ir symptoms, because its much cheaper than berberine. hope this info helps someone else out there. i wish i knew about this over a decade ago. i feel like my life was robbed from me by this illness.",/r/PCOS/comments/15rcmq1/berberine_inositol_is_making_my_periods_lighter/,19
"A rant, vent, confession or something...","just needed to get this off my chest. a family member made an unsolicited comment about my body today. a family member that i have not seen nor has seen me in about 5 years. five years has been a lifetime encapsulated by life, transition, trauma, healing, pandemic, depression...all of which have separated me from who i was then to who i am now. they said you gained weight... they trail off, the lilt in their voice a combination of confirmation and curiosity. as if i didnt know. past me, disordered eating me, unhealthy and untreated anxiety, depression, selfloathing, external validation seeking, and pcos me would have had an emotional breakdown upon hearing those words from another person. it would have wrecked me in the, and it didseveral times over. in fact, it previously did. another distant family friend previously said, drunkenly one time i liked you better when you were skinny. back then, i crumbled and retreated into the trenches of selfloathing and selfisolation. but today, i nodded and said yeah, i did. but i didnt say it in the evasive, pseudojokingly way i have said it in the past. it was just casual confirmation yes, i did. what people in the outside world dont understand is that this vesselour bodyis imprinted with so many stories that others either cannot read, do not understand, or selfrighteously criticize with entitlement and projection of their own insecuritiesselfhating internal dialogue. what they do not see is recovery from a near fatal car accident that has changed the physical and mental fluidity of my former body and mind. what they do not see is the overwhelming and mounting stress, depression, anxiety, and trauma that wrecked havoc on and ravaged my insides causing inflammation, emotional eating, inner turmoil, internalized shame and guilt, and social isolation. what they do not see is the countless times i have poked, prodded, surgically attempted to alter, lasered away parts of myself that i was ashamed of and wanted to hide because i believed i was not worthy to be seen. im not saying that i am totally healed. i have a long way to go, but i am saying that me, and all of you, are not reflections of the unsolicited opinions of others on what our bodies should look or feel like. the you and me in the mirror are reflections of survivors, healing, evolved, loving, gorgeous, incredible, sexy, intelligent, empathetic humans. rant over. thank you, abundantly, if you took the time to read this. i send you all warmth, love, and healing as we all just try to navigate this life dealing with things that are often just outside of our control.",/r/PCOS/comments/v3kisz/a_rant_vent_confession_or_something/,19

Does the calories in calories out rule still apply for ladies with PCOS?,"that may sound pretty dumb... so please dont scold me for asking. i struggled with my weight starting as a young teen, that coupled with nasty remarks from my mum on the daily about it i ended up with a eating disorder that lasted the better part of 10 years. in my mid 20s i finally had a scan got a diagnosis. plus the body hair, acne, missed periods, dark skin surprised i didnt get diagnoses sooner. so a year ago i went into treatment for my eating disorder. i gained a 9 kg and was sitting at a normal weight. up until this point ive been eating my required amount of calories, but avoiding specific foods bread, starchy vege, dairy, sugar, pasta, cheese because i know how my body feels when i have that stuff. my therapist said that i am not allowed to restrict any food and i need to start eating those things in moderation. i actually shit you not ive put on 5kg in less than 4 weeks. i havent been going overboard on food. i had a bloody eating disorder for 10 years, i know how to track my food. my therapist doctor said its calories in calories out, and that my body must be adjusting to things and nothing to do with pcos. but i dont believe them? i dont feel right about it and im worried if i continue to gain weight i may slip out of my eating disorder recovery. im trying to save to go private to see a dietitian and gyno, in hope that they might tell me my therapist has it wrong. do you guys think it would be worth it?",/r/PCOS/comments/g05s0y/does_the_calories_in_calories_out_rule_still/,16
I’m still gaining body fat despite diet and exercise. Any tips for weight loss with PCOS?,"tw for talks of disordered eating and negative body image. i 30f was finally diagnosed with insulin resistant pcos this past november 2022 after having my symptoms dismissed by various doctors since 2021 when they first started. ive been on metformin and birth control for several months now, which have really improved my symptoms of cystic acne, hair loss, irregular periods, daytime fatigue, etc. my problem is im still struggling to lose body fat. im fine with the number on the scale, but the issue im running into is im still gaining inches and body fat. ive gone up a couple sizes over the past 2 years, am currently around 30 body fat, and have almost lost my waist completely and now have an apple shape. i currently workout 45 times a week, dont own a car and walk everywhere, drink plenty of water, get enough sleep, countlog my calories and everything i eat, stay in a calorie deficit, take probiotics and berberine, and recently went on a high protein diet 100115 grams per day. and still, it doesnt seem to be working. i have all of this stubborn fat especially in my stomach that i just cant lose. most of my clothes dont fit me anymore, i look like im a few months pregnant, and i feel uncomfortable in my body every single day. has anyone been able to successfully reverse this? im interested in weight lifting and am strongly considering liposuction once i can save up enough money because nothing else has worked for me. but in the meantime, does anyone else have any advice on what i could try? for reference, intermittent fasting is off the table for me because im in recovery from binge eating disorder. additionally, i also have crohns disease, so im a bit limited in the diets i can choose. everything doctors normally say to include in a healthy diet tons of fruits and vegetables, whole grains instead of white flour, quinoa, legumes, nuts, seeds, etc. im actually supposed to avoid. i cant eat too many of the foods listed without spending half the day on the toilet and experiencing horrible abdominal pain. carbs are one of the few things i can eat that dont bother my stomach, which is probably why im having such a hard time losing weight. ive been able to reduce the amount of carbs i eat, but keeping them extremely low or cutting them out completely is also not an option for me. any tips would be appreciated.",/r/PCOS/comments/15dysd4/im_still_gaining_body_fat_despite_diet_and/,16

My PCOS turned out to be endometriosis ,"hey everyone! im making this post because im truly hoping it could help at least one other person out there whos been left in the lurch by their worsening symptoms. i was tentatively diagnosed with pcos at 20 i am now 25. i was diagnosed on the basis of being overweight b belly or apron belly dark, male pattern hair growth on chin, jaw and chest that seemed to worsen as i progressed through my 20s difficulty losing weight, and then struggling to maintain weight loss constant cravings for sugar painful, heavy and long periods crippling pms that would hit 12 weeks prior to a period every blood panel came back normal, my internal ultrasounds showed no signs of cysts, and my periods were always very regular and were only abnormal when affected by hormonal birth control. my periods seemed to be less brutal whenever i ate using the dash diet or a keto diet, and when i did manage to lose some weight i noticed an overall improvement to my health and wellness. also in classic pcos fashion, i only seemed to be able to budge the weight when i was prescribed metformin and then duromine, which i combined with walking more, doing strength training and then following that up with incline walks on the treadmill, as well as trying to eat antiinflammatory foods more often. ive lost 15kg, but gained that back in the last 16 months. i had a mirena inserted in march 2023 and my gosh was it absolutely hell. the insertion pain was brutal, the cramping afterwards was the worst thing ive ever experienced, and it took 6 months to properly settle. after those 6 months, i noticed these recurrent symptoms that i passed off as pcos sharp pain from right and left ovaries at ovulation but also randomly sharp, deep and localised pain at the uterus sharp pain at the belly button cramping pains after orgasm regardless of there being penetration hip and back pain lethargy this improved a bit with the mirena as my lethargy was related to my cycle which has essentially been put on hold by the mirena strong cramping during my cycle cycles on mirena were just as if not more painful than my natural cycle, but i was barely passing any blood let alone uterine tissue i had my laparoscopy on the 7th of march this year and am currently a week postop. i never would have had this lap if i hadnt have switched to a new gynaecologist to have a routine pap, a colposcopy and biopsy done under anaesthetic, as my iud experience the year before left me with genuine ptsd and there was no way i was getting in a chair ever again. after describing my symptoms, my dr suggested we also do a lap as according to him, pain as i described isnt typically caused by pcos. well, he found endo tissue around both ovaries, two spots of tissue behind my uterus and growth on the fallopian tubes. he also inserted another mirena and has advised that it should hopefully be years before i have any more growth that requires a lap as the mirena will slow any endo tissue, and he also excised the tissue surrounding the growths so there hopefully shouldnt be any cells left behind. all i need to do from here on out is focus on getting my weight down to my goal of 90kg, which is ideal for my height and figure, and incorporating and maintaining lifestyle changes that i will finally have the mental capacity, energy, and motivation to upkeep now that i will be free from the pain, lethargy, mental fog and exhaustion associated with my endometriosis. so, is it still pcos? i guess who really knows! ill have to monitor how my body is feeling after recovery, and ill probably bring it up with my dr when i see him for my 6 week followup. i can absolutely update this post with that info when i have it. feel free to ask any questions, im an open book! thanks all for reading",/r/PCOS/comments/1bdrz5m/my_pcos_turned_out_to_be_endometriosis/,14

LONG. Recent diagnosis after 10+ years of being told it was all in my head.,"yesterday i was angry, then depressed, then more angry, and then finally relieved. ive been struggling with irregular periods for twenty years. i was on the pill for almost 18 of those years, so got a regular period and figured everything was fine. every doctor told me that it was probably just my young body figuring itself out. in my late adolescence and throughout my 20s, i struggled with depression, increasing anxiety, thinning hair, adult acne, folliculitis, and somatic symptom disorder within the past year actually creating physical symptoms that several doctors claimed were not due to any physical ailment. great, im turning into a hypochondriac. not wanting to seem crazy, i dealt with all these issues privately for years at a time until a genuine medical condition warranted a doctor visit, then would go through several tests that found nothing wrong, and feel okay for a few more months, assuming all my issues were just in my head. just need to meditate and do more yoga, exercise and eat more whole foods, selfcare selfcare selfcare. i have always had the sense that i had to work harder at selfcare, particularly nutrition and exercise, to maintain a healthy body weight and any semblance of being emotionally well enough to lead a normal life. last year, after my amazing husband had a vasectomy, i was able to go off the pill and all my problems relating to periods returned i got my first period 28 days as expected, then the days between periods increased to 35, 41, 43, 52, 61, then 72 days. yesterday i was finally given an ultrasound to further examine irregular menses, and it took them all of five fucking minutes to discover that my ovaries are more than 50 covered in cysts. research helped me discover that pcos can cause every single fucking symptom i have ever been told to ignore. symptoms that have almost led me to seek disability in the past and give up on trying to drive to work. symptoms that have led me to feel suicidal and hopeless for so many years. my doctor told me that there was never any reason to investigate further since i wasnt actively trying to conceive. a whole new level of anger arises when i think about how many woman with pcos dont know and never will because they arent trying to have babies. i sense from this community that many of you also relate to this anger. relief arose when i realized that this gives me a whole new outlook on what i can and cannot control, and new parameters that will help me not beat myself up emotionally so much. ive been in therapy for several years and will get to continue with a new path. ive been focused on eating whole foods and regular exercise for about eight years, and now i know that i need a little more recovery time, more healthy whole foods, and a lot more love for myself when things arent perfect. tldr doctors ignored my symptoms for years, making me think it was entirely psychological, turns out i have pcos but no one thought to check since i dont want kids. was super pissed but now just slightly pissed with positive outlook. edit not beat myself up.",/r/PCOS/comments/6hfdbu/long_recent_diagnosis_after_10_years_of_being/,12

"Surgery scheduled, having big feelings about it","ive dealt with pcos since hitting puberty 27 years ago. i was diagnosed in my early 20s based on the assessment criteria hirsutism, weight gain, and missed periods. every time i talked to doctors to try and manage my symptoms, i was either told to just lose weight or dismissed entirely because i wasnt trying to have kids. ive always been ambivalent about having them. a couple months ago, i started having pelvic pain, andlong story shorti had my first ultrasound, and they found a concerningly large cyst on my right ovary. so large, that theres barely any ovary tissue. come to find out, this cyst is special its a dermoid cyst. unlike other ovarian cysts that are filled with fluid, this one is made up of excessiveextraneous tissues they can often contain things like hair and teeth. apparently, dermoid cysts can show up anywhere on your body, and youre usually born with them. so now im having surgery to remove the ovary entirely. ive also opted to have a bilateral salpingectomy removal of both fallopian tubes, since im almost 40, i dont want kids, and... well... gestures at the state of the us. plus side, bilateral salps also reduce the risk of cancer in the ovary im hopefully keeping. i say hopefully, because theres a 1520 chance that it also has the same kind of cyst on it. if the surgeon discovers one, were just going to remove it also, while theyve got me on the table. im just kind of processing everything, right now. im not upset about sterilization as ive mentioned, i dont want children. but im pretty angry that something as simple as an ultrasound was able to give me more answers as to why my body is this way, and that it was never offered to me when i was originally diagnosed with pcos. i guess they figured since i had the 3 stereotypical symptoms, there was no need... after all the crash diets, excessive exercising that led to sports injuries, spending thousands on supplements and medications, and feeling like my body betrayed me, i could have known about this literal years earlier. it would have saved a lot of heartache. im also terrified of surgery. its an irrational fear of mine logically the idea of surgery has never bothered me and makes perfect sense, but when i think about actually going through it, my lizard brain wants to hide under a rock. the good news is the surgery is laproscopic and outpatient. and my mom is traveling the 700 miles from her home to stay with me and take care of me. i guess tldr, make sure youre asking your docs for everything you can to verify your diagnosis. also, anybody thats had this kind of surgery, any advice on how to speedease recovery?",/r/PCOS/comments/1k6evts/surgery_scheduled_having_big_feelings_about_it/,10

"I've had a rough couple weeks, and I just need to vent about this stupid syndrome for a minute.","obligatory backstory, ill try to keep it short. diagnosed with pcos at 16 because i had my very first period at 12, and the second when i was 15. ive never had a cyst in my ovaries but every other symptom i exhibit on a textbook level. ive been onoff treatment birth control, metformin, spironolactone, you name it for about 8 years now. pelvic pain is a pretty common symptom for me. sometimes when i stand up or sit down, i get a lot of pain in my uterus. sometimes its just a tinge of pain in an ovary, intercourse is dreadful and painful. my libido died a long time ago and being in a committed relationship it has taken a toll in too many ways. i went to my gyn, had an ultrasound internal and external, had an annual and they found nothing. the next step was a diagnostic laparascopy. i had the procedure done and during the recovery portion, where i still hadnt talked to my gyn about everything he found, he referred me to an endocrinologist. when i got there, she reluctantly ran a bunch of tests insulin, cholesterol, liver enzymes, etc and lectured me for over an hour about how overweight i am, how nothing is medical is likely wrong, how im killing myself. i told her that i had pcos, she said pcos is a rule out diagnosis. its overdiagnosed and it sometimes is a crutch for women who cant lose weight. i told her about my history, that we had ruled everything out, that i do have liver issues because of the pcos, that ive been treated. she insisted that i was just fat and that was that. she told me to stay on the birth control if i believe its pcos and that was the treatment. today, i had my follow up appointment regarding the laparoscopy. endometriosis everywhere. he spent an hour just burning it all off on the operating table. we sat down together and made a plan stay on the vestura birth control, generic yaz and skip the placebo week. if the pain comes back, hell move me to the depo shot where i wont have a period. he said to expect weight gain on the shot if we go that route, and because of my other medical issues, it could reach 5060lbs in the first year. we will try that until im old enough to have a hysterectomy. unlike quite a bit of you here, i dont want children and i respect that everyone has a different goal. today, the pharmacy called me and told me that the endocrinologist called in a prescription for me, metformin er. i tried to call their office to see if the test results were in, they wouldnt give me any information and she had me set up an appointment with a dietitian... you know, because im a giant fat mess. to top it off, the maintenance guy at work that comes around to pick up our garbage midday looked at me, pointed at my stomach and said hey! happy mothers day to you!. i just want to crawl into a hole and stay there forever. i know that without a period, my pcos symptoms will go out of control. if i take the placebo week of birth control, my endometriosis will come back. i feel like my body is a warzone and im trapped. i dont feel like a girl, ill never feel like a woman. i have hirsutism, hair loss, weight gain, you name it. i feel miserable and lost in this disease that ive been carrying around forever. thanks for listening, i just needed to vent. please share your stories with pcosendometriosis if youve experienced the treatment, i would love to hear something positive about this if there is hope.",/r/PCOS/comments/2563tw/ive_had_a_rough_couple_weeks_and_i_just_need_to/,7

So apparently having cramps so bad you vomit and pass out from the pain aren'r normal you say...,"im 35. every since i started my period it has been a nightmare. an unpredictable nightmare. ive never cycled normally. i dont understand those women who talk about 28 day cycles. i have lived with a lot of ruined underwear. when my dear aunt flow decided to show up, most months she takes me down with a vengeance. thankfully my period is usually only 2 or 3 days but 2 of those days are absolute misery. i have cramps so bad that i have vomited in my trashcan at work. i have a high pain tolerance. i walked around with a broken foot for a day once but i have passed out from the pain from these cramps. up until i found this sub, i thought this was somewhat normal. i thought i was just one of the unlucky ones who has a more painful period. i told my doctors but no one said that this was not normal. i had relief for about 2 years when i didnt have a period. the doc tried to get me to go on progesterone but i was so thankful to be cramp free i took the risk of not doing it. i told my doctor about the cramps and that i would rather risk complications from no period than have the cramps. i still was not informed that cramps of this magnitude were not normal. years ago i had two cysts rupture. i ended up in the er because i didnt know what the pain was. this is when i first learned i had pcos. when discussing my medical history we talked about the cramps. i still was not informed that cramps of this magnitude were not normal. how did i make it 35 years and not ever know this was not normal? i have a gp, a gyn and an endo. how has no one told me this is not normal? im to the point where i want to get an oophorectomy andor hysterectomy but im afraid of the recovery time. ive always been athletic and worked out and i dont want to give that up. i dont really know where im going with this rant.. i just cant believe how many doctors have just ignored my pain and told me it was normal and that woman feels this. the months when i actually ovulate i can feel it and it hurts. i have to take strong painkillers to actually function when i am ovulating. this is not normal. none of my other friends have ever vomited or passed out from period pain or have pain when they ovulate.",/r/PCOS/comments/f9g30k/so_apparently_having_cramps_so_bad_you_vomit_and/,9
Years after diagnosis I finally feel like I'm getting the help I need!

I’m exhausted.,"i just want to rant about the bullshit that is womens healthcare. this is long. i started menstruating when i was 11, and im currently 29. my period has always been heavy and extremely painful, and otc painkillers barely help. when i was around 1819 i learned about pcos and asked my doctor to do tests and my bloodwork showed increased androgen levels so she put me on birth control tricyclen lo. it made a huge difference until i was around 25, at which point i started bleeding heavily again and the pain got worse. ive also had several ultrasounds over the years and my ovaries always appear normal. my doctor switched me to some stronger bc pills and they did not work. it got so bad that i was bleeding about 3 weeks out of each month, and i finally got a referral to a gyno. gyno also put me on different bc pills nonstop without placebo week in the hopes that it would slow down or stop my period altogether. didnt work at all. after almost a year of this at this point i had been bleeding almost nonstop for about 2 years she suggested a mirena. my gyno also wanted to do a dc so she suggested that we do the iud insertion at the same time since id be sedated already. i agreed because i was truly at a loss and bleeding so much constantly. i got the mirena in august 2023. the cramping since then has gotten even worse tbh didnt know that was possible considering how intense the pain already was this entire time. i also hemorrhaged for 50 days from decfeb. in february i asked my gyno for a hysterectomy and she said if that was what i really wanted then she would help me, but she needed a second opinion in order for it to be legally authorized we are in canada. she referred me to another gyno who called me less than a month later and asked me a bunch of questions essentially confirming that i understood what the surgery would entail and that i was providing informed consent. she approved the surgery but because we are in canada the waitlist is over a year long. she also said she suspects possible endometriosis and that if she finds it during the hysterectomy that she will remove what she can, but i will continue to have the pain and might need more surgery later on to continue removing the endo. the hysterectomy would remove everything except my ovaries and id continue having other pcos symptoms hirsutism, acne, etc. just without the bleeding. i said i can deal with that, but i cant deal with the bloodloss and pain anymore. i cried after that phone call because i felt so relieved that someone finally listened to me and my needs. in the meantime, the gynos recommended that on top of the iud, i start taking aspendienogest daily. it has helped lighten my flow and the pain has improved a little bit i still get these sudden stabbing pains which knock the wind out of me, but they are less frequent now. i remember asking my doctor for a hysterectomy when i was 18 because i knew i didnt want kids and i felt like going through this for several more decades until i eventually hit menopause was cruel. she said no and seemed almost horrified that i even requested it. when i spoke with her recently she mentioned seeing that i was approved for surgery and waitlisted, and seemed happy for me. i reminded her that she had rejected my request a decade ago and all that really did was prolong my suffering, to which all she had to say was that 18 was too young for such a surgery im currently taking the dienogest daily, still have the iud gyno said removing it now might make the situation worse so to keep it in until the surgery next year, and then my dermatologist put me on spironolactone for my hidradenitis suppurativa hs last month. i read that spironolactone is supposed to help with pcos as well. my derm said that when i stop dienogest after my surgery, the hs could get worse. the hope is that the spironolactone will help pcos symptoms and hs symptoms long term. it feels like no matter what, im going to struggle for the rest of my life with these 2 conditions. im just trying to get through the next while until i get my surgery date. im terrified of surgery, and ive heard the recovery can be brutal. but whats some more pain and discomfort when i know it will be temporary? im also scared that im ingesting so many hormones. im so tired. all the time. tldr after a decade of asking for a hysterectomy, i was finally approved and waitlisted. doctors have been pumping my body with hormones to get my bleeding under control but it barely works. womens healthcare is archaic and im scared ill suffer forever in some capacity.",/r/PCOS/comments/1drixe8/im_exhausted/,6
Wholesome support system post,"i have been struggling with pcos for several years. the symptoms i struggle with most are my abnormal periods, excessive facial hair, and inability to lose weight. over the last two years i have made several changes in attempt to feel better. i walk 10k steps everyday, changed my diet, tried laser hair removal, tried electrolysis, and intermittent fasting. my two best male friends are aware of my fitness journey and my struggle with attaining the results i so deeply desire. my friends and i share our apple watch stats with each other daily so they see me burning 600800 calories a day with little to show for it. last week i had a consultation with a surgeon to have vaser liposuction performed. i have wanted this for years and it is no secret. upon booking my surgery date i confided in my two friends separately for emotional support. my one friend who is completely ripped, no health issues, hetero male, also related to me immediately became upset with me and implied that this was the easy way out of putting in hard work. he went on to say it was stupid of me to waste my money on something superficial and went to great length to say how much he doesnt support me. this hurt. i got off the phone and cried like a baby. maybe he was right? i just couldnt imagine waking up every day for another year having to obsess over the lack of progress i was seeing given the amount of work i was putting in. after a day recovering from the emotional toll telling my first friend about my surgery, i decided to tell my other friendqueer, chosen family. he immediately became ecstatic and asked for more details and how he could help. before offering to help care for my dog after my procedure, he said i know how difficult it is with your pcos. youve been putting in so much work and you deserve to be happy and comfortable in your own skin. i immediately got emotional and asked him how he even remembered or knew how pcos effected thisme. he said well after you told me about it i went on reddit and did as much research as i could to understand what you are experiencing as if it was nothing! i had to sit down. there are so many instances where i try to explain what it is like to have pcos to those who arent cysters and feel like its either dismissed or not taken seriously. this was a big moment for me. 4 days ago i had my procedure and my friend has stuck by me and been the best hype and supporter i could ever ask for. when i was in surgery he came and took care of my dog. he called me, came to see me, went on short recovery walks with me. we all deserve friendship like this. someone who goes above and beyond to listen and empathize with our experiences. if you have a friend like this, hold them close. edit i know that this procedure wont cure my pcos. but i am excited to have a better relationship with the way i feel in my own skin.",/r/PCOS/comments/zocc9k/wholesome_support_system_post/,7
Mini pill experience?,"id been on estrogen birth control for 8 years and it was a total dream, cured all pcos symptoms no periods, no hirsutism, not a single pimple, pmdd gone, no noticeable side effects. unfortunately, i fell into the very small percentage of women who develop liver tumors from the pill and can never take estrogen again. it was the only type of birth control id ever taken. my pcos symptoms all came back with a vengeance, and regulating my period and acne especially is hard. i developed severe anemia pretty quickly from the periods. my cycle varies from 2045 days. to combat all this and test out a new bc method, i started the mini pill 2 weeks ago. my period has been late even by its usual standards at 65 days with spotting only, but i have severe cramps. i think it may have also made my hormonal acne even worse. is this normal for the mini pill? whats the breaking in period? im really on the fence about my options because none of them seem good cant have an iud because of other health reasons, cant have any estrogen bc. seeing a derm soon to consider spirinolactone or another solution because otc does nothing. if mini pill doesnt work to help periods and acne, i am considering a hysterectomy for permanent birth control because im unsure what else to do. i dont want kids, but it would be difficult to deal with the recovery period.",/r/PCOS/comments/uy7hyb/mini_pill_experience/,6
Me (25F) dealing with PCOS and my boyfriend (26M),"this is my very first post ever and it seems to be just the place i need to be to discuss this ruthless, incurable stupid freaking disorder that is ruining my life... let me start from the beginning...i got my period when i was 16 years old and since the beginning it has been very, very irregular. i would go months without periods resulting in usually only having to deal with it 3 times a year. i guess you could say at that point i was lucky...it sure seems like it to me at this point anyway. alwaysin the back of my mindi felt like i would have fertility issues because i didnt have a normal period. it was one of those things that i considered, but it didnt really matter to me at the time i was young. then..6 years into my toxic relationship, i was preggers. 11 freaking weeks and didnt have a clue. now, this is not a post based on ectopic pregnancies so i will try to make this part short, but i do think its relevant to my point and situation... anyway...after i found out i was pregnant after a trip to the shore and intense stomach pains the doctor in the emergency room confirmed that i was pregnant and urged me to make an appointment with my doctor 48 hours from then. at the time, i was 22 and was scared shitless, but kind of happy because maybe i didnt have a fertility issue? maybe i was actually able to have kids and at the time i thought i was in love with that bastard that i had been with for 6 years already so why not?..unfortunately the pain intensified the next day and i rushed back to the hospital to find out that i was having a miscarriage the bastard didnt show up until 4am when i had already been there since 6pm. 6am i was sent home to recover after an hour of the gyn team removing the sac and whatever else gooey stuff was in my stomach that needed to be removed. at 8am, i was rushed back to the hospital, as my mom found me passed out and bleeding on the bathroom floor at this point she didnt know about the pregnancy at all. as soon as i got into the hospital they put me in a wheel chair and wheeled me back for pain meds and monitoring....after hours of pain, guess what they found? i was still pregnant. miscarried one baby and the other one was somewhere they couldnt find. maybe it was still traveling in my fallopian tube...they said. that day i went in for surgery where they made 4 incisions to try to find the baby...hours later they came up with nothing. when i woke up the next day, they asked me to discuss with my mom what i wanted to do. as i was slowly and painfully eating breakfast, i discussed my feelings with my mom....i never got to finish that conversation. somewhere along in our discussion, i lost consciousness. i remember not being able to breathe and my monitor beeping really fast and my mom crying and doctors coming in. everything was just in and out and such a blur. they took me back into surgery, gave me a blood transfusion, found the baby and terminated the pregnancy. luckily my mom made a big and i mean big fuss about not taking my left ovary and fallopian tube thanks mom. i know i ended this part of the story in a rush and there are so many questions left unanswered, but the point is that it was fatal to my life. it almost killed me and no my boyfriend did not come to visit me before, during, or after my surgeries nor did he take care of me for 8 months during my recovery. anyway...with that being said...after briefing you of my history and that experience, i want to bring you to where i am, today. 2 years later 2014, after all of that physical, emotional, and mental torment, i starting dating my amazing boyfriend. in august 2014, we reconnected we met each other a year prior and in december we decided to date. december 6, i began bleeding. january 6, i was still bleeding. february 6, march 6, april 6, may 6, june 6..and so on to the present, i am still bleeding. januarymay were the hardest. i, almost needed a transfusion. how the hell do you go from bleeding 3 times a year to everyday for practically a year? i have no idea and neither do my doctors. somewhere along the way they diagnosed me with pcos and told me i wouldnt stop bleeding and i have to be on progesterone and iron pills for the rest of my life...dont know what to do and im devastated. i cant help but to think that my ectopic played some role in this...either that or my pcos played a role in my ectopic, which it highly likely as pcos is very hard to identify and could have easily been overlooked. in fact, most people who are diagnosed with pcos had it years before they were diagnosed by a doctor. anyway, through it all, my boyfriend has been there 100 through the mood swings and bloody massacre in my underwear sometimes in his bed and hasnt complained. needless to say, i love him so much and dont know what i would do without him. my issue with pcos and my boyfriend is that when i hurt...he hurts. when i get frustrated...he gives me supportive advice, but he is frustrated, too. when i come from the doctors with no answers, he is just as frustrated with the doctors as i am. when i am 1000 degrees at night time, he cant even touch me or cuddle with me. when i am in pain and cant lay down or stand up or sit down, he cant help me. medicine hasnt helped me. when he wants to go to the gym with me, im exhausted... i know he is going to get tired of this soon...i mean..its only a matter of time...but what do i do? going to the doctors depresses me, so i try not to go oftenespecially because between the copays and medicine its really expensivenot to mention having an unlimited supply of tampons and pads.i dont want to lose him, but i cant cure myself either. no one i know has ever experienced thiseven those with pcosso i feel so alone. i dont know what to do. i dont want to vent to my boyfriend because he has expressed that knowing that when i am hurting and he cant do anything about it hurts him...i dont want to be a burden on my boyfriend, but, selfishly, i dont want to lose him either. i feel like a broken dirty plastic doll that is piled under the pretty porcelain dolls on a childs shelf. thats what i feel like when i walk around or go to work and hang out with my boyfriend and their friends and girlfriends. its not fair. sorry for the lengthy vent...i guess what i needed to do was vent and see if there was possibly anyone who has gone through this experience like mine and overcome it? how did it affect your relationship? how are you living with it? does it get better?",/r/PCOS/comments/3kcrtg/me_25f_dealing_with_pcos_and_my_boyfriend_26m/,7
Struggling with an Eating Disorder and PCOS,"let me rant for a minute. i am 22 and have delt with amenorrhea aka not having periods since i got my first period at 13. i have only had exactly two natural aka not produced by birth control periods in my life and i was barely diagnosed with pcos a month ago. even though ive had an endocrinologist since i was 12 my doctor ruled out pcos from the get go because i didnt have hirsutism and was too thin to have pcos. although i have always had out of control cholesterol and high testosterone, my doctors only feedback was to cut out eggs, watch my diet and get on birth control. flash forward 5 years by the time i became a collegiate athlete and serious distance runner that diet advice and athleticinduced body dysmorphia had turned into a full blown eating disorder. at that point, regardless of my undiagnosed pcos, my body was too thin and undernourished to menstruate. by the time i realized i had a problem with excessive exercise and restriction and went into recovery for an eating disorder, my doctors recommendation was just to gain weight to get my period back. over the past year i put my food and body issues to the side and gained about 30 pounds, hoping that the extra weight would finally allow me to menstruate. now with all that weight on my 50 frame my pcos has developed into full form. im hungrier than ever, still have thinning hair, and am constantly battling insulin resistance and lethargy and now depressive episodes. even though i thought gaining weight to restore a nourished body would balance my hormones and allow me to finally have a period, im experiencing the worst pcos symptoms ive ever had. now after 10 years of dramatic weight loss and gain, body dysmorphia and serious food issues i was finally diagnosed with pcos. a simple diagnosis from the beginning could have saved me from struggling with my body for the past 10 years. i now feel that im stuck in a larger body than before and trapped amidst a load of pcos symptoms. its especially difficult and demoralizing as most of the advice on how to manage pcos symptoms and insulin resistance focuses on dieting and completely changing ones diet. i feel that this option however isnt available to me as someone whos had an eating disorder before and cant trust themselves with restricting their food options or portion size once again. this type of advice has always been tough for me anyways as i generally eat a super balanced diet, almost never eat processed or fast food and typically incorporate all of the foods that are suggested healthy fats, whole grains, superfoods, etc. i feel stuck between a rock and hard place and am overall struggling with the fact that most of my attempts to improve my health have resulted in either a disordered mindset or worsening my symptoms. i feel stuck and at a loss who knew living a balanced life in a healthy body could be so hard?",/r/PCOS/comments/t3s8u3/struggling_with_an_eating_disorder_and_pcos/,6
Settling on abnormal,"ive never had a normal period. ever. from the age of 13 on, my menstrual cycle has been wack. started out nonstop. was put on bc a year later to regulate. made me feel crazy, so i went off and period went awol. tried depo and the pill during late teensearly 20s to prevent pregnancy and period always went awol after stopping. earlymid 20s i tried to get pregnant in my prime since my doctor who dx me said it would be very hard to be fertile regardless married young. went to fertility specialist. metformin and clovid did nothing. 6am post coital tests really dampened our sex lives. gave up after 1 yr. 8 or 9 months later, after feeling resigned from natural motherhood and pending a move overseas, i miraculously fell pregnant after having no period to speak of for almost a year. we had a healthy son. there was a few months after my recovery with my first born that i had a normal period. i actually knew what regular ovulation felt like for 2 whole months. became pregnant again and had my 2nd, a daughter 25 months after my son was born. i consider both of my pregnancies akin to winning the lottery. that was almost 10 years ago. my period has not been normal since. not even close. ive been tracking my period for years and the closest ive gotten is a 35 day cycle, which teases me into believing it will start to regulate. lol then comes the 40, 45, 60 day cycles that have been my normal. anyway, im not quite sure the reasoning behind this post, aside from sharing the message that i, after 20 years of pcos, will never expect normal. i have always yearned for it. it will never happen. all i can do is wait patiently for menopause and try to avoid highsugar foods, which is the only thing i know that helps my symptoms. i say this on cycle day 37. thinking that because i got my period around the same time last month and the months before that it would get better. i am cramping so bad with no period because my body is trying to ovulate. if you are like me, then know you are not alone. im just looking for some comradarie through the dysfunction. it wouldnt be so bad if not for the feeling of not being a normal female, the pain, and the other aggravating symptoms that come with this syndrome.",/r/PCOS/comments/rt4p66/settling_on_abnormal/,5
Breastfeeding,"this is just a little information sharing i wish i had earlier i posted before and deleted as others were rude and commenting that my own personal experience with pcos was not valid. remember pcos presents differently for everyone this information is for those who may share some of my struggles. i wish i knew this with my first child. due to hormones shocking right?! many people with pcos develop sloping breasts that go to the side and are longer rather than rounder. this is due to hormones limiting the development of breast tissue. as such, when it comes to breastfeeding it can and will limit the amount of milk produced. according to the two lactation consultants i am currently seeing things can be done prior to birth to increase supply as much as possible. so long story short ask for a lactation consultant familiar with pcos during your prenatal visits!! pregnancy and recovery are difficult enough, i felt so lost and tired with breastfeeding and like i was doing something wrong when really it was just the pcos, story of our lives right?! for now i combo feed, i make as much breastmilk as i can and then i make sure my baby is fed and healthy by supplementing with formula",/r/PCOS/comments/vsj0dk/breastfeeding/,6
PCOS has made me hate everything about myself,getting a pcos diagnosis and now having to live with these symptoms is ruining my life. i gain tons of weight quickly and out of my control even when im trying to lose weight. i used to be a fitness instructor but had to stop because i realized that the high level of cardio that i loved was actually making my hunger and symptoms worse. i am an avid baker and it has been a huge part of my life my whole life and i have pretty much stopped because i cant have sugar. i dont drink i dont do anything fun. i have a history with anorexia and although i was in full recovery for years i am back in full swing with my anorexia voice that lives in my head again. i hate my reflection and i hate how i look. i feel like a complete failure. im embarrassed of who i am and i feel like all the parts of me i liked have been taken away by pcos. my body feels so out of my control and i feel like the way i look was how i told myself i would never lookdespite being someone who prided herself in eating crazy healthy and working out all the time. i feel like i look like someone who just does the opposite. i dont want to go on ozempic because i know that would be bad for my anorexia recovery so please no comments about weight loss drugs but i daydream about it. i daydream about plastic surgery in a way i never have again im happy if that makes you happy but that would not be my happy path. i just daydream about being literally anyone other than me. my husband tells me all the time that he loves the way i look and that he loves me but i just cant believe him and some part of my hates me so much that hearing him say he loves me makes me wonder whats wrong with him and i know thats crazy. i miss feeling pretty and not like the ugliest thing to ever walk on this planet. i feel like ill never feel like myself again or get to do what i love again. im constantly hungry and my whole life revolves around food. to the point where i dont even sleep well cause im hungry no matter what i eat. i cant even hang out without friends unless its meticulously timed with meals. my life completely revolves around pcos and it makes me so sad. im seeing a new doctor who is health at every size haes certified and even tho so far shes nice its hard for me to have hope at all. i think im just gonna hate everything about me forever. idk what i want from this post i guess other than i just needed to rant somewhere to people who may understand. this is so unfair and so hard and i feel like so many people just dont get that.,/r/PCOS/comments/1jeoqv8/pcos_has_made_me_hate_everything_about_myself/,5
Finally saw a doctor about PCOS. I'm so happy.,"i had gotten a spiro prescription from an online doctor alpha medical after extensive blood tests but was desperate to see an actual doctor face to face, get an ultrasound, etc. ive been so terrified of doing so because i dont want someone to just tell me to lose weight and kick rocks essentially. i have a history with disordered eating and have only been in recovery for about a year and a half now. my life finally doesnt revolve around my weight appearance diet exercise and ive never been happier! i had my doctors appointment on wednesday and felt so great about it. an ultrasound showed the appearance of my ovaries is consistent with pcos yay for official diagnosis! and my doctor spoke about potentially increasing my spiro dosage after my blood test results come back. she was so kind, never once mentioned weight changing my diet. the ultrasound also revealed that my iud is in the very wrong place and needs to be replaced. i told my last gyno the one i saw throughout my teens into early 20s before moving that sex was painful for me with my iud and she said itll pass. didnt even offer an ultrasound. she recommended against switching my iud to relieve terrible period symptoms and i marched straight to pp to get one anyway best decision i ever made. her skinny ass would also always ask, in the most condescending tone, and how are we staying active these days? i dont miss her. sorry, i digress. having a great doctor is such a great feeling. i feel so lucky i got a good one on my first try. my advice to anyone who feels uncomfortable with their doctor get a new one. there are better ones out there! eta i also told my last gyno about my hirsutism, she ordered a blood test, and then never ever followed up about the results. i was young and embarrassed enough having to bring up my hair growth, i never followed up and have since been so bitter about her terrible bedside manner. gah i could go on!!",/r/PCOS/comments/saaqij/finally_saw_a_doctor_about_pcos_im_so_happy/,6

"New doc, new diagnosis, new plan, new fears!","i was diagnosed with pcos in 2006 after a few years ttc unsuccessfully. i had always had signs, but apparently it wasnt widely known aboutdoctors didnt care enough to do anything about it. an ultrasound showed dozens of cysts, ovaries like a christmas tree according to my re. things happened, now its almost 10 years later. i had a few early miscarriages, split up with my partner, decided i didnt want kids. lost about 65 lbs so far doing slightly modified keto. pretty regular periods, but still some problems with thempcos. got put on tri nessa but after 2 months where i spent more time with a period than without, i sought a pcos specialist. well. i saw him today. after asking me tons of questions and fielding every single one of mine, he wanted to do an ultrasound, which i had expected. but then out of left field, he also told me he suspects i may have endometriosis due to my meeting all the basic criteria except one. im 33, and spent 3 years dealing with infertility docs, and not a single one ever brought this up. so we do the ultrasound, and in addition to the expected pcos cysts, there is a large, irregularshaped one that he believes is an endometrial cyst. he was very proketo yay! and took me off the bcp. he rxd some bloodwork, 2 months of progesterone, and a follow up in a month to talk about laparoscopic surgery to check forremove any endometriosis as well as ovarian drilling. he said he would likely put me back on metformin, which i took in my ttc days, but would not prescribe spiro for hair, and that i would likely see better results for hair with the drilling. he said after that point we could discuss either another form of bcp or something like the implant, he specifically did not recommend depo and i do not want an iud. right now im kind of freaking out. i have a thing about doctors as it is, and even more so when it comes to surgery. my main goals are a lessening of the pcos symptoms and continued weight loss i want to lose about 7080 more pounds. im sure there are those of you have done this. i did a search but got a lot of horror stories from a long time ago and freaked myself out even more. whos done it recently? has it helped you at all? how was your recovery? thanks for helping answering this scared, anxious girls questions.",/r/PCOS/comments/30ztgn/new_doc_new_diagnosis_new_plan_new_fears/,4
Exacerbated Insulin Resistance after Surgery,"hi all, i just had my gall bladder remover for reasons other than pcos, but noticed that i was feeling ravenous and lightheaded since surgery. calorically, i am eating enough food to more than cover any extra energy cost of healing, so i was thinking i might be having a flare up of insulin resistance. i looked, and there seems to be a lot of medical literature on increased insulin resistance after surgery. what i couldnt find online were any strategies for people recovering from surgery to reduce their insulin resistance. most of the solutions in the literature are directing anesthesiologists to administer glucose or insulin prior toduring surgery, which obviously is no longer applicable. i called my surgeon, and their np instructed me to increase my calorie intake to manage the feeling of lightheaded hunger, which needless to say, did not seem like great advice to me, as i think this would likely cause me to 1 gain additional weight and 2 slow my recovery toward insulin sensitivity. any advice on addressing 1 and 2?",/r/PCOS/comments/w9kwht/exacerbated_insulin_resistance_after_surgery/,6
What’s one small thing you started doing following your PCOS diagnosis to help?,"hi! hope the title makes sense. basically what im asking is, what small habit or mindset change! did you pick up that helped you see results with weight lossbetter managing your pcos? relatively recently i was diagnosed with pcos insulin resistance and have been working on losing weight managing my pcos, but im so overwhelmed! when i was diagnosed, i was given medication but zero guidance. since then, ive read up on pcos a lot but im so overwhelmed by all the information and everything people say you have to do that i almost feel paralyzed by how overwhelmed i am with it if that makes sense lol. im hoping that starting with one or two small things will allow me to adjust to that and start seeing some positive changes and then i can keep adding things also, right before my diagnosis i was struggling with an eating disorder which was the first time i was actually seeing significant weight loss. since starting recovery, ive gained the weight back plus extra of course and its so hard for me to try this weight lossimproving my health without veering right back into my ed since thats what worked. so if anyone can speak to maintaining that balance i would really appreciate that too! okay thank you",/r/PCOS/comments/1mcf6sx/whats_one_small_thing_you_started_doing_following/,4
PCOS and low heart rate?,"ive always had low blood pressure and low heart rate, and i didnt really think much of it until i joined orangetheory a heart rate based exercise class. it takes a ton of work to get into the orange zone, and i cant really stay in it for more than 23 minutes. after ive completed an all out, i do a walk and recovery and im almost immediately back in the blue zone. im usually one of the ones with the lowest heart rate on the board, even though im running and some people are walking. anyway, im starting to wonder if the low heart rate is related to pcos. i have heard some podcasts about how they are considering renaming pcos to metabolic cardiovascular disorder or something like that, i forget the exact name. it made me think that maybe the pcos is responsible for the low heart rate. i know with pcos we are at higher risk heart disease and stroke too. im interested to hear thoughts and if anyone else has this experience. also, for a little extra info, i guess im considered lean pcos, im 51 and 120 lbs. im also on metformin if that makes a difference.",/r/PCOS/comments/5o47zi/pcos_and_low_heart_rate/,4

Anxious about having an ovarian drilling,"hi all, im 37 and ttc. ive been diagnosed with pcos and hashimotos disease. ive had painful and irregular periods all my life. ive also put on a lot of weight over the years and struggle to lose any weight. ive been taking glucophage and euthyrox for a number of years now after my diagnosis. i feel as though time is running out for me to have a family. ive only had one pregnancy that ended in a miscarriage. ive been to a few gynaecologists in the past few years looking for help. recently my doctor recommended another gynaecologist with a good track record for women who are struggling to conceive. i finally saw him two weeks ago. the ultrasound showed that my ovaries are very polycystic. my ovaries had improved in the past after taking androcur which was prescribed by another doctor. that was however over a period of a year. the new doctor prescribed femostan which is to be started with my next period. he also suggested that the best option for me is to do an ovarian drilling, thereafter i should ttc within the first month. he also said that my husband should do a sperm count after the procedure. im really nervous about the ovarian drilling procedure. i see from research and older posts that it is somewhat of an outdated procedure. but on the other hand i feel a bit desperate given my age and other health issues counting against me. is there anyone that had luck getting pregnant after this procedure? what is the recovery like? are the effects long lasting? does it help you to lose weight afterward?",/r/PCOS/comments/1aiukoc/anxious_about_having_an_ovarian_drilling/,4

"feeling overwhelmed by new symptoms, needing lifestyle change part Rant/part Advice","hi everyone. this is my first time posting so i hope everything i say is alright? im sorry for the long post! i just wanted to provide context! topics covered hair loss, insulin resistance symptoms, hormone belly, diet change, comorbidities x200b i 26nb was diagnosed about 2 years ago along with endometriosis. i have had endometriosis symptoms since i was probably 13 years old, but only pcos symptoms for the past 3 4 years that started with extremeeeee jaw acne cyclically. i went to the obgyn for the first time 2 years ago since i was 18. i avoided going because of course the first one i went to just told me i have dysmenorrhea lol and to take extra strength midol lol. i lived with extreme endo symptoms for years before my therapist finally convinced me to try going to the doctor again. when i went to see one, she noticed my jaw acne and my belly and got my bloodwork done. all she did to treat both was prescribe me birth control, but then she found out my family has a history of blood clots. she mentioned some sort of bloodwork i could get done to see if this was something i would have to worry about, but that it could be between hundreds to 10,000???? i just decided not to take it altogether, because wtf? the iud is also problematic for me with my specific endo issues. it was around a 3 years ago pre diagnosis i pretty much lost my sex drive, still barely have one at all. then the hair loss came a couple months later after diagnosis two years ago. i saw a derm and she prescribed rogaine. as i sit here i just brushed off 10 strands from my shoulders which ive of course been doing all day. a little later on, the weight gain came super suddenly. i try to exercise but i also have fibromyalgia yay comorbidity so its very difficult to maintain an exercise routine with the fatigue could barely stay awake today, dizziness, i have to do low impact stuff cause i pull muscles easily ! now, im experiencing what im seeing here are insulin resistance symptoms. good grieffff. im just feeling a tad..... overwhelmed by each new symptom on top of everything else. im trying so hard to switch to a low carb diet. im vegan and i have been since i was 14 years old. when i see cutting out dairy and stuff being suggested i feel a little hopeless! like dang i already did that. i eat a lotttt of veggies naturally but my vegan partner eats a lot of carbs with 0 issue, so ill give in for convenience and feel awful! like my work was undone with one meal. it took me so long to achieve intuitive eating in ed recovery, but this past year that has started to completely work against me with the insulin resistance symptoms. ill eat a full meal, a carb heavy one, and feel like my blood sugar is crashing. i get shaky and dizzy like i havent eaten about 20 minutes after eating. ive also gained an objectively significant amount of concentrated weight in my mid belly and elsewhere but not like this. i had not a clue that the specific place where im seeing a lot of fat is not only specific to pcos, but specific to insulin symptoms! i guess feeling like i dont know where to start contributes to the overwhelmed feeling, and maybe its just a struggle cause of how suddenly it happened, and how i didnt even realize it was a real problem. im pretty used to feeling bad and having to live with it so but i guess im just in an adjustment period. ive been surfing this forum for a bit and have realized ive never even thought to go to an endocrinologist. that gives me hope, but covid throws a wrench in that plan which is just... frustrating lol. has anyone met with an endocrinologist remotely via webcam? i know blood work is necessary initially though i came across the phrase metabolic chaos and thats straight up how i feel. i just want my hair to stop falling out, to stop feeling like complete physical shit, to feel some semblance of the self esteem i was finally starting to feel! i guess with all of this, i first and foremost just need to get it off my chest to people who understand. especially with how quickly new symptoms can present. my partner and close friends are supportive, but dont have pcos so i dont really talk about it too much with them. i just ask my partner to be mindful that im trying to change my diet and stuff or obviously when they see my symptomsendo is talked about a lot more. i secondly just want to finally put my feelers out to people who actually have pcos if anyone with the same symptoms have any resources or tips theyd be willing to take time to share while i comb through all these posts. thank you for existing!",/r/PCOS/comments/hs45wq/feeling_overwhelmed_by_new_symptoms_needing/,5
Looking for Advice on Where to Start,"hello. i 26f was just diagnosed with pcos. i feel like i was solely diagnosed because i have irregular cycles which go from 2440 days and sometimes skip. i have had my thyroid checked 3 times before and nothing came up. my blood sugar on blood tests are always fine. i dont have acne or hair issues and ive never had the ultrasound of my ovaries. so i kind of feel a little skeptical because i thought you had to meet two of the criteria. one symptom that i have that would match but isnt for diagnostic purposes is that i have a lot of belly weight im 250lbs and have a big hanging belly no shame we give her lover to help her heal. my husband and i are looking to try for kids starting next year and i just had my iud taken out yesterday morning with a new obgyn who is the woman who diagnosed me. ive had 2 prior gyns bring it to my attention and a dietician. she told me very matter of fact and when i was like my blood work never comes back with anything she was like it doesnt need to. and then told me if i dont get a period in the next 4 months to come back. then i scared myself by looking up that 7080 of women with pcos have infertility. i feel like i need some sort of game plan. im definitely down for some weight loss, im just also in recovery from a lot of disordered eating so i dont want to put too much pressure there. ive also already been increasing my movement and have never liked running or stuff like that so im good there. i just feel a little lost though outside of that the obgyn rushed me out of there so quick she was still talking as she was walking out the door.",/r/PCOS/comments/121ihmq/looking_for_advice_on_where_to_start/,6

PCOS since I was 16,"hi eveyrone. i found this subreddit randomly yesterday. i was pretty excited to find it as there are not many people that i know that have and struggle with pcos. so i was diagnosed officially with pcos when i was 25. however, symptoms started between the ages of 1416 yrs old. i grew up in a super small town where the doctors knew dick all. i started my period when i was about 11, but then it stopped completely between said age years. i remember thinking yesss!! this is awesome! but then i was like wait this is kind of concerning too. our family doctor told me that as long as i was having my period every 36 months then there is nothing to worry about. ill be fine. whenever i did have my period, it was embarrassingly heavy, painful, and passed clots all of the time. i was also having weird issues with my vagina too. like, i would try to put in a tampon, but it would pop right out again. i had no idea what was really going on. when i had graduated from college and had real heath insurance, i went to go see an obgyn. at this point in my life, it seemed normal to me to not be able to have a pap smear and they would always order things like vaginal ultrasounds no fun super uncomfortable. when i did have a pap or an ultrasound, it was always undeniably painful. so the md that i had seen around the age of 25, he said two things i think you have pcos. well order labs. did you know that your vagina is thickly sealed with a membrane that is thicker than the hymen? i didnt know the later, and the labs i had done releveled i did have pcos. so he ordered oral birth control and he said, i think it would be better if you considered surgery to remove the thick membrane. it will make sex a less painful experience for you and your future partner. so, i had decided to have surgery and although a painful recovery it helped a lot for my future. when i was about 30ish, i had seen an endocrinologist and he had again confirmed that i had pcos. i then saw another obgyn as at the time i was struggling with migraines. the ob said that it would be beneficial for me to have an iud for hormone control and help with my migraines. so i had my first iud and then had another placed 5 years later. that one fell out, and in january of this year i had another placed. that one recently fell out almost and it was super painful. as recent as last week, i had that iud removed and nexplanon placed. i am curious about how it will work. side note, the surgery on my hymenvaginal area helped a lot. it made my female exams more comfortable and of course later, sex a lot more comfortable. any way thats my story. i am curious if anyone else has had surgery like i had or if i am just weird. have a good one!",/r/PCOS/comments/nhxw55/pcos_since_i_was_16/,3

Looking for advice on discussing concerns with ob/gyn,"content warning for the following topics weight gain loss, infertility, brief mention of eating disorder recovery, mention of fertility treatments, pregnancy complications, miscarriages, hellps, ppd ppa im currently 20 years old, i was diagnosed with pcos at 16 after telling my doctor i hadnt had a period in about a year after receiving both a normal abdominal ultrasound and transvaginal ultrasound as they discovered a large number of follicles on my ovaries. i was told infertility and potential pregnancy complications would likely be something i experience in the future with increasing difficulty around 25yo. at the time i was not ovulating and hadnt in a bit, birth control was advised as i was sexually active and didnt want to get pregnant on accident without any idea because i didnt have a period to be a warning sign. i was on nexplanon for 2 years during those two years i gained weight, the weight gain was not birth control related just ed recovery with serious weight fluctuations but i have lost over 60lbs since june of 2022, 35lbs of the 60lbs since may of 2023, i got the implant removed in october of 2023 because i was having periods for the first time in over 3 years when the birth control was removed i was told the periods were not because of ovulation just hormonal changes. when i got off nexplanon i had one period around the same time i was getting them in the last couple months i was on birth control. well its now january and i have continued to lose weight anywhere from a slight change to few lbs a week never gaining the previous weeks weight back i have in no way been trying to lose weight nor bragging about weight loss just trying to give you an idea of my current weight changes im 54 and 190lbs currently i do not have many of the same symptoms that brought up concerns and eventually lead to my pcos diagnosis when i was 16. my only concern is sporadic light bleeding lasting anywhere from a few hours to a couple days its not on any type of schedule just some days im bleeding or spotting for a few hours or here and there for 1 or 2 days then somedays i have no bleeding at all. i take a pregnancy test every 2 weeks to check and i am not currently and have never been pregnant. the bleeding is not heavy like my periods were when i was 1114 and its not completely absent. i dont have excess hair growth or acne like before either. i brought these concerns up with my obgyn i was told i was not ovulating and have likely not ovulated in years even before my diagnosis at 16. she followed this heartbreaking news by telling not to worry about my concerns if i wasnt trying to get pregnant at this very moment because theres medical assistance that will help me ovulate and fertility treatments available. she knows im not trying to get pregnant like today but that me and my partner were hoping to start trying later this year early next year. i just really want to see if theres anything other than just jumping straight into inducing ovulation and fertility treatments that any of you recommend or if you might have tips on how to approach this topic with an obgyn who seems to push medical assistance straight away. its important to note infertility issues are very prevalent in my family all women my mother older sister aunts and grandmother have had struggles conceiving and all encourage me to seek help for these concerns before actively trying to convince because fertility treatments do not work for everyone and have lead to pregnancy complications such as several miscarriages for all women in my family, lead to my mother developing hellp syndrome while pregnant with me, several other health complications during and after birth as well as severe postpartum depression and anxiety. these medical interventions are also very expensive and i worry about them being used before trying anything else because i worry i spend so much money trying over and over that in the event they prove to be unsuccessful it would be some time before me and my partner would be financially and emotionally ready to look into other options.",/r/PCOS/comments/19d5ivh/looking_for_advice_on_discussing_concerns_with/,4

My first laparoscopy to pop some cysts (March 10).

Progress Update + My PCOS experiences!,"hey yall! this community has been so helpful to meive been a lurker. reading other folks stories and experiences has helped me learn about pcos and what my body and brain need to be healthy. i thought id come out of lurking mode and share my experiences too! im 33, afab, white, and able bodied. ive been married to the sweetest, kindest person for almost four years and i have really incredible friends. cw brief mentions of suicidal ideation. i was diagnosed with pcos and pmdd in november 2024 after years of fluctuating weight, intense back pain, irregular periods, suicidal ideation, dandruff, fatigue, low or no libido, depression, irritability, beard and chest hair growth, nausea, dizziness, etc. first, what was most helpful in getting my diagnoses was journaling my symptoms for yearsi use cycles journaland it helped me see just how much pain i was in and how fatigued i was. ive always had a tough time trusting myself the pain wasnt that bad or i must be imagining it or im probably just lazy, so being able to see the patterns in my symptoms was massive in going to an obgyn ready to advocate for myself. ill group my experiences by medssupplements, food, physical health, and mental health though theyre all connected, wow! meds started in november unless otherwise noted loestrin hormonal birth control i know many folks dont do well with birth control, but its been huge for my pmdd. i ran out once and within two days my suicidal ideation came back inositol i use opositivs cycle support i ran out for five days and my fatigue, dizzinesslightheadedness, nausea, and sugar cravings came back strong. taking inositol has given me so much more energy, and has enabled me to move my body consistently, i love it so much. its but folate toxicity sucks so ive learned to stick to the serving size vitamin d3 k2 i had a vitamin d deficiency, my levels are up to normal range now, and since i started supplementing vitamin d, my super intense dandruff potentially sebhorreic dermatitis is almost nonexistent berberine i use wholesome storys berberine learned about it here on the pcos reddit!. i started it feb 18, going to stop taking it in may to avoid longterm stomach damage. it controls my blood sugar in a big way, and ive got to be careful about when i take it and how i eat. i always eat something or have a protein shake around 30 minutes after i take it. once i took it after eating and my blood sugar crashed hard. maudes libido gummies these have fenugreek, which is supposed to help with blood flow. i dont know how much these have made a difference, since, honestly, finally loving my body has helped my libido more than anything else. of everything i take, i dont worry if i run out of these. magnesium i use natural vitalitys calm gummies, take four before bed. i dont sleep as well when i dont take these, especially when i move my body a lot. from what i understand, this helps break downprocess cortisol. food i wont get into the detailed specifics of what i eat i think theres a lot of bad vs good food conversation everywhere, and i know its not helpful for me! so i try to think of foods as morally neutral, and i think about whether theyre helpful or not helpful for me. ill name categories of stuff thats been helpfulunhelpful, just remember we all have different bodies and theres no one size fits all! some of the signals that helped me learn about how food impacts my body inflammatory pain i get a really specific pain in between my shoulder blades when i have unhelpful foodsdrinks. alcohol and refined sugar are big culprits of this for me. bloatingpuffiness maybe this is another type of inflammation, but what triggers this is dairy and saturated fats sugar rush high glycemic foods like potatoes, womp womp make my face feel like i ate a bunch of sugar. its wild. feeling too full for the most part, helpful food doesnt make me feel that oof feeling after a meal. i feel satisfied but not packed, and i dont get tired after meals. examples of helpful foods for my specific body legumes, whole wheat pasta, fruits, veggies, tuna, salmon, avocado oil, 80 dark chocolate, peanut butter all natural, kimchi, sauerkraut examples of unhelpful foods for my specific body alcohol, anything fried, refined sugar, dairy, bread as ive changed my diet, my tastes have changed! really dark chocolate tastes sweet to me! and, its important to name that this isnt all willpower. i think the inositol really helped me manage my craving and make these changes sustainable. the other thing thats helped is learning to think of my body as my home. ive been so at war with my body for so long that i never learned to listen to my body or care for it. i always held my mind as separate from my body and wow, hey, turns out theyre all part of the same system. for me, punishing my body because it was too big or too weak or not enough never worked. instead, i try to think about what kind of fuel i need to live the life i want to live. so i have protein shakes every day, too! i use oras vegan protein because whey doesnt agree with my body. edited to add i know i am in a calorie deficit, but i dont track calories because i have a history of disordered eating and tracking calories sends me down a dark road. i fuel enough to feel strong! its a feeling it out sort of thingif im irritable or weak or lightheaded, i havent eaten enough. id also much rather eat more than i need than less, these things take time. physical health at my heaviest, i was 213 pounds im 59. at that point september 2023 i was diagnosed with high cholesterol and put on a statin, but no inkling of pcos. i made some diet changes and tried to work out consistently, but i still didnt have the energy to stay motivated or the strength to keep from getting injured. i was able to get to 190 on my own, but things stalled out and still fluctuated quite a bit. when i got my pcos diagnosis and started taking the supplements and meds i described above, everything changed. being able to manage my pmdd meant i could be more consistent, and having energy meant i could finally build strength. heres what ive been doing for movement starting in november i rode an indoor bike for 30 minutes at high intensity for 5 days a week. in december i upped my riding time to 45 mins 6 days a week january i upped to 50 minutes 5 days a week and started adding 10 minutes of seated pushups and resistance band exercises while on the bike february i upped to 60 minute rides 5 days a week and began adding 30 minutes of strength work 3 days a week march i kept that routine going until i burnt out too much cardio! i was exhausted. i took 4 days off and came back feeling much stronger. note its so easy for me to think i have to move my body every day and do the most and go the hardest and wow its actually so harmful to do that. i also think that learning to trust my body my exhaustion is not always because of pcos, im exhausted because im in a body that needs rest and learning the differences between fatigue and tiredness, wow. but learning to work hard and be gentle is a balance. now, in april, im pulling way back on cardio and focusing on strength. there are so many threads on here that say focus on strength! and i wish i would have listened earlier!! im doing the following routine monday 30 mins core, 20 mins bike tuesday 30 mins upper body, 20 mins bike wednesday active recovery 30 mins mobility work thursday 30 mins core, 20 mins bike friday 30 mins upper body, 20 mins bike satsun rest or riding bikes around nyc my results so far are 165 pounds down 25 pounds since diagnosis, down 48 pounds overall im way stronger. i can carry groceries, carry my suitcase, do yard work, etc. with more ease and safety. i feel capable! i feel goodless pain, better posture, and clothes fit better for the first time in years, i like the way i look. i wasnt sure that would ever happen again! this one was wacky, but i dont smell the same. my body odor was a bit rough before november, and my bellybutton was stinky! now, no belly button stink and my body odor is only noticeable if i get really anxious! my hair is stronger and i shed less dandruff is nonexistent nails are stronger my ankles dont swell when i walk my joints dont hurt im about 1520 pounds away from my goal weight, but im already trying to transition to a strength building mentality from a weight loss mentality so i can set myself up for consistency. mental health wow wow wow this one is huge. and, there are so many factors that go into thisbut having consistency in my hormones has helped me keep consistent routines, even if i dont feel like it! i journal every morning shoutout cycles journal, i love it, work out, stretch, and shower all before work. this felt indulgent at first, like i was so selfinvolved to have a three to four hour routine in the morning, but its been such a lovely way to care for myself and my body. the confidence that comes with weight loss and muscle gain is really nice, but most of my confidence is coming from feeling like i can operate in my world in a more effective way. i can have more fun, im a more present friend, im better at my job, my brain fog is gone, im less scared of the world and of myself, and i have so much more energy. im a more present partner, and i really do believe now that my body is my home and that i deserve a nice home. getting a diagnosis and lurking on this subreddit have been life changing. also! i didnt do any of this alone. friends, my partner, an obgyn who believed me and my experience, the internet, the right meds, wowi think we have a habit of thinking this is about willpower and morality and people who get this stuff figured out are better than folks who dont and thats so brutal. alsoi wouldnt say that ive reversed my symptoms. if i get super stressed, my symptoms flare up. this is a chronic condition that im planning on managing for a long time. if that changes, ill update this post!! im happy to talk about any of this stuff, and im so grateful to other folks here for sharing their experiences. edited to add info about how much im eating",/r/PCOS/comments/1jpad7v/progress_update_my_pcos_experiences/,4

Tell me about your D&C?,"hi all. ive been lurking here for a couple of weeks, first time poster though. i was diagnosed with pcos young 15 my symptoms were mostly managed with birth control and metformin on and off for years. the last few years unfortunately have been rough and i went off all meds and havent seen a doctor until recently for almost 4 years. for the past 10 months now ive had constant bleeding ranging from spotting to bleeding through a tampon, pad, clothing, and all over my car seat in seconds with clots the size of my fist. i finally saw a doctor last month and after some testing... she wants me to get a dc to remove all the thick vascular endometrial lining that has built up. at 29, my partner and i are starting to think about having children, i know its a ways off but im scared about cancer and needing a hysterectomy or something. and, in the more immediate future about the dc. i know i will be put under for it... but im still so nervous. have any of you had one? how painful was it? was there any sort of recovery time needed? should i take multiple days off work?",/r/PCOS/comments/6ypefx/tell_me_about_your_dc/,4
Doctor was not helpful…,"today i went to my second endo. off the bat she told me that pcos is caused by being overweight and then went on to tell me to never eat past 7, only drink water, and to limit my calories. im in recovery from an eating disorder and i made this super clear off the bat, in my chart and in my introduction of my background. im open to losing weight but id prefer to focus on making lifestyle changes exercise, better sleep, balanced nutrition. not just cutting calories. also, even when i was at my lowest weight in the depths of an eating disorder, i still had pcos and terrible acne. i just feel so misunderstood and unseen. is anyone in recovery and managing their pcos? have you found good doctors? i desperately want a doctor and endo who understands both pcos and eating disorders without throwing bc at me looking for support, kind words, and friends.",/r/PCOS/comments/ows1aa/doctor_was_not_helpful/,4
Binge Eating and PCOS advice,"i have been looking at binge eating recovery advice online and a prominent one is to eat whatever you want without feeling any guilt about it. naturally, your body will stop feeling guilty and suppressed, leading to fewer binges. however, as someone with pcos and is insulin resistant, i feel like i got hit by a train after i eat starch. that is the main thing i crave and binge. does anyone have advice on binge eating recovery with pcos? i have no idea how to intuitively eat because it feels like my brain is just screaming carbs carbs carbs. i am not clinically diagnosed with any mental illness, but i do have pretty intense mood swings that certainly contribute to this negative feedback loop.",/r/PCOS/comments/1fumqef/binge_eating_and_pcos_advice/,4

I have now been on my period for 8 months. Now with a Von Willebrand's disease diagnosis (along with my PCOS and Endo) my doctor is now willing to preform a ablation and tubial ligation on me! What can I expect?,"hey guys. it has been a brutal 8 months. feel free to check my post history for context. but here is a brief history of what happened leading up to today perhaps i should first specify i am 23 and have never been pregnant. 1. was bleeding for 3 straight months. very heavily. 2. after many tests and ultrasounds, was diagnosed with pcos. in october. 3. was also suggested that i might have a stage 1 or 2 case of endo because of the thickness of my uterine lining 16mm and other painful symptoms. 4. had iud inserted mid october 2014. 5. bleeding got crazy heavy. 6. could feel some soft of mass coming out of my cervix. had polyp removed in...early november, i think it was. 7. took several courses of progesterone and estrogen. over these months. as well as iron pills, and i also had a iron infusion. and i also saw another ongyn who specializes in endo and she was of no help. she suggested removing my iud in 6 months and using nuva ring my regular obgyn disagreed. 8. was tested for endrometial infection and given antibiotics anyway, even though the results were negative. took those. kept bleeding. finished these early february. 9. was hospitalized for toxic shock syndrome. sickest ive even been in my life. because i am bleeding buckets and have been for months, i left a tampon in and unknowingly inserted another, pushing that one back. after 2 days i was really sick. antibiotics and a hospital stay for that. 10. saw a reproductive endocrinologist who recommended i see a hematologist and also gave me more hormones. finished another two week set of estrogen and 10 days of progesterone, to no avail. 11. saw a hematologist. he thinks i have von willebrands based on my tests. he suggested i go through with my ablation that i desperately wanted but no one would do it because im young and that will hopefully stop the bleeding. if not, he wants me to see a specialist for rare bleeding disorders. 12. with my cardiologists help i have pots and faint all the time and this has been destroying my body my reproductive endocrinologist who is the guy to see in my network about these surgeries agreed to to my tubal ligation and ablation.. what can i expect recovery wise and procedure wise? symptom relief wise?",/r/PCOS/comments/2ztguu/i_have_now_been_on_my_period_for_8_months_now/,4

what's the best thing you've done for your PCOS?,"not sure what to flair this as, mods feel free to change please do not talk to me about weight loss or any type of dieting. its not an option and my doctor is against me pursuing it. not to mention i am still in recovery. at this point in time i follow intuitive eating. i naturally lean away from carbs and dairy. what is the best thing youve done for your pcos outside of changing your diet? im 17 and pcos runs in my family. ive never had a consistent period since i was 13, and my struggles with body acne and body hair have gotten worse since. i also have mood problems because of it. since 2018, ive developed a 6cm lump in my breast it deflates when my period comes, so i came to the conclusion on my own that its hormonal and not cancerous, and in 2019 i saw a specialist doctor who agreed with me on that. i didnt get help till 2019 because i am overweight and my gp just hates me i guesshad a medically recognized ed and she still would just send me home with 20 page myplate printouts and tell me its my weight, despite me being a very active person throughout my teens and even losing tons of weight due to anorexia. but i finally got a referral to a womens specialist for my ed and she immediately got my blood tests done as soon as she saw my stomach trail haha. im looking into things i can do to improve my life with pcos. i have considered getting an iud and medication. i tried medications once and i had pain so great i was literally praying to god to let me pass peacefully. i never took it after that and unfortunately lost contact with my doctor. ive just recontacted her. she doesnt want me to do any sort of dieting or weight loss 1 because i already have a good diet and 2 i have a history of ed. exercise is limited because of pain with my breast size but im not super out of shape. so, whats the best thing youve done for your pcos? i just need to hear from actual people not google. im scared that ill never be able to manage this, and i just want to reach a point where my body feels alive again. i miss being active and feeling good in my body.",/r/PCOS/comments/jmeuzn/whats_the_best_thing_youve_done_for_your_pcos/,3
Had Endo ablation and question supplements ,"new poster but ive been in the community for a while lol. im semi newly officially diagnosed with pcos as of a few months ago but had endometrial ablation completed sept 2023 and its been the best decision for my health. i consider myself to be one of the lucky ones that recovery was easy and minor crampingbleeding but now no longer have periods at all. the only medication i am on is for bp and high cholesterol currently taking losartan, prescription omega 3, and atorvastatin. due to recent official diagnosis of pcos, i have been taking wholesome story inositol but will be switching to theralogix version due to higher dose and cheaper option in the long term usage. i also take the wholesome story nac i wished theralogix would have their own version and im not sure why they dont. all that to say is that ive noticed a difference in just the two weeks of using inositol unfortunately lower dosage but now taking 8 pills and nac with eatingsleeping and overall feeling well. however i am interested in taking more supplements to assist in overall health and to get off prescription meds and im looking for guidance. im aware of the following supplements and was wanting feedback on the following im using theralogix branded names as i was leaning towards using their products. neoq10 coq10 curcusorb curcumin theromega fish oil i am thinking of switching to their multivitamin as well and i was also thinking of taking their vitamin d however if i do so i was going to do both to get the total vit. d dosage to 4000iu as the mutil vitamin has vit d of 2000iu and then one dosage of vit d 2000iu. i apologize for the long post as im an overthinker and i dont want to waste any more time and money with getting some supplements that i may not need. tia!",/r/PCOS/comments/1c26lzh/had_endo_ablation_and_question_supplements/,3
Fasting Blood Sugar Frustration,"hey everyone, first post here. i check my fbs regularly and it normally ranges in the 80s with the occasional low 90s. this past week it has been high 90s101. i know that is not terrible but frankly, i have so much anxiety around it due to my mom telling me as a fat child that i would die of diabetes. i exercise regularly walk at least 30 minutes strength train 3x a week and typically follow a diet that is low gi and low carb not keto that is not for me but i do monitor my carbs because it helps my pcos. i should mention that if is not for me either. i have a diagnosed ed and am currently in recovery. i am on metformin 1000mg, 500 2x a day, i take ovasitol but admittedly was slacking for a few months and recently started religiously taking it again 2x a day. before metformin and ovasitol my bs was ranging low to mid 90s, with just metformin it was mid 80s to low 90s, and take 1000mg berberine. currently i am on my period yay really yay, we all know how challenging it can be to get your period with pcos and have been sick. my a1c was 5.5 springearly summer, which was down from the previous time i had it tested it was 5.7 last fall and my fbs when it was 5.7 was normal in the 90s. sorry if i sound dumb. i always had symptoms of pcos externally diagnosed at 1314 and struggled with ir but my blood sugars were always very normal even when i was super overweight, until i was pregnanthad my child so i am still very much learning how to manage this portion, and honestly to manage my pcos because lets face it our resources were minimal in 2002 and still are. thankful for this community. am i freakingout needlessly? i know worrying isnt good for myself, my pcos or my insulin resistance and i am trying not to worry. i have scheduled a doctors appt but she cant see me until september so i am just hoping to hear dont worry or at least hey you arent alone.",/r/PCOS/comments/15flfrz/fasting_blood_sugar_frustration/,3
Feels like my mom just brushes me off,"a little bit of back story first i didnt get my period until i was 16 years old. late but not too abnormal. they were slightly irregular then but my mom kept saying thats normal. but things started getting weird when i was 17 and it went away for 9 months. i was very worried and it was at this time that google led me to discover what pcos was and i matched almost all the symptoms. when i expressed my concerns to my she kept saying either itll come back, stop worrying so much. that used to happen to me i have that to that does mean anything or some combination of those. if memory servers, she even got a friend off hers to tell me that it would come back. well it did come back and was regular for a while so all is good right? flash forward to 2020, im in eating disorder recovery. due in part to having to eat much more food, not being allowed to exercise, and basically being sedentary for 3 months because of quarantine, i put on 20lbs and my period went away again i was already overweight when i started ed recovery. the doctor there suggested i go to the obgyn and i learned that not having a period for that long isnt normal. so eventually after months of my period still not coming back and my mom still telling me itd come back, i searched for gyn by that point, i hadnt had a period in 9 months. long story short, my gyn said that while my female and male hormones are balanced, the male hormones are still way too high and from that point on, ive been on birth control and lost the weight i gained in recovery and then some. anyway my mom has the same condition i do but i can hardly vent to her about it. she just brushes it off. for example, when i tell her im worried ill never have children or in the very least, will have to go though hell and back just to have them, she just brushes my concerns off and says something along the lines off why are you so worried about that? focus on other things or well i had you so dont worry and best of all i have a friend who has one ovary and she has kids so why are you so worried? to be fair, i am 21 but the fact that infertility is even list as a symptom worries me because i want to start a family some day when i tell her i dont feel feminine enough she says dont be ridiculous. my body hair some people just have that. i cant talk to the one person closest to me about this because she just brushes it off constantly. so frustrating. im a little angry at her because had she taken me seriously when i was younger, i couldve gotten diagnosed and treated sooner. it is what it is now but im just so frustrated. edit sorry if this is too long of a read. i just wanted to get everything i felt was related to this out",/r/PCOS/comments/udvfvc/feels_like_my_mom_just_brushes_me_off/,3
In hope of getting a good grasp on all things PCOS,"hello, i am in dire need of help and advice from yall. to provide a brief background i was diagnosed with pcos at 17. im 22 now. my periods used to be regular at 18 when i used to actively go to gym everyday even though i was 20 kgs overweight at that time. my skin was better, i had no excess body hair, no facial hair, no fatigue, or scalp hair loss. then i suffered an injury a ligament tear on my ankle and the recovery took 6 months. by then, the stress of college had also increased and i never got back to working out actively again after that. for the next three years, i was put on increasing doses of metformin for my insulin resistance. for me, it made matters worse. my diet was all processed carbs, junk, sugar. my sleep schedule was out of whack. stress all day, every day. no physical activity. i used to get terrible hunger pangs, i used to be ravenous despite eating ample food. i was also prescribed birth control pills a 21 day course every 7 days or sumthin.. cant remember exactly. they did result in bleeding.. but i didnt take them regularly cause i wasnt confident about being dependent on bc pills. throughout the pandemic, i was pretty much depressed, anxious, and beyond caring. things got worse than the worst. entirety of 2021 i didnt get my period. i piled on 20 more kgs and as of dec 2021 i reached my highest ever 100 kgs 220 pounds when i saw the scale reach a three digit on a kg measurement.. i was shocked out of my wits. i decided that i cant keep going on like this. i consulted a dietitian at the beginning of december. she gave me a gluten free diet for the first week to address the bloating. just about 1 and a half week into the diet i got my first naturally occurring period. i was so happy. then she took me off of the gluten free plan since shes of the ideology that not any food group should be restricted. cause once you lose weight, and then get back on a normal unplanned diet with that restricted food group included you gain weight back rapidly. idk what you guys think about that but i personally agree with her. so its been 1011 weeks of consultation. i have lost 11 kgs 24 pounds. im currently at 196 lbs. unfortunately, i didnt get my period for january. im hoping i get it soon this month. i do yoga with light body weight based exercises. i also aim for 10,000 steps a day but i do achieve up to 8000. the way my diet plan goes.. it seems to be an if following a 1410 routine. there are salads, vegetables, fruits, eggs, cottage cheese indian paneer very rich in protein, oatbran based breads, fully skimmed milk, granola, dry fruits and a number of seeds pumpkin, chia etc incorporated in my diet. im a lactoovo vegetarian. um, im not comfortable with chicken and other meat products.. i have no serious reason for it. i just dont like the smell and chewy texture. this is just for me though, ive grown up that way. i dont judge anyone. my own sibling and my dad are hard core non vegetarians, they enjoy pork, beef, lamb, sea food.. so yeah, it all boils down to a mere preference and comfort zone for me. i love eggs though. ive researched keto and watched various videos by jason fung, eric berg, ken berry.. regarding keto, if, omad, fasting. im comfortable fasting with liquid intake but only once every 23 days. but the rest of the stuff doesnt seem to be a sustainable and feasible lifestyle choice for me. i cannot maintain ketosis, or deal with hunger pangs of 168, 204 if routines. im bogged down with academic deadlines and i cant afford to expend mental energy worrying about every meal. its just gonna add to stress and a cortisol response, getting in the way of my weight loss. my facial hair mostly under chin and jaw has gotten worse. i dont know whether its worth it getting laser treatment done right now if my own bodily hormones are out of order. every day i get out of shower and feel low and disappointed looking at the fine but dark hair on my breasts and stomach, and the thick happy trail from my belly button. i feel so underconfident. i have this blubbery abdominal area which i think is called a hormonal belly. my waist to hip ratio is beyond far from normal. even though ive lost 20 pounds , i cant help but ruminate over the 60 pounds i still need to lose. in addition, im worried of what the heck is up with my hormones at the moment. i decided that i wont go see a gynaecologist as they always just give me birth control, metformin and tell me to lose weight. i already know that and i already tried those medicines. i dont want to be on birth control. i want to ovulate and have a natural frickin menstrual cycle. i dont want an artificial inducement of just bleeding without ovulation. i want to get my progesterone in order. im just.. i feel hopeless and anxious. i ordered spearmint herbal tea the other day. i heard it helps lower androgens in women w pcos. id appreciate if anyone can weigh in with anything a shared experience, a word of advice, motivation, links to useful resources, information, a doctor, diet suggestions, medicine suggestion.. anything. p.s. anyone from india or other south asian nations here?",/r/PCOS/comments/swa9ci/in_hope_of_getting_a_good_grasp_on_all_things_pcos/,2
Navigating PCOS and ED Recovery,"hi, everyone! tw talk of ed, weightloss so, i was diagnosed with pcos in december and i have been feeling generally lost since my diagnosis. i have dealt with a lot of conflicting emotions, mainly frustration that receiving a diagnosis has made me feel more confused, when i guess maybe i was expecting it to provide relief? i say this mainly because the only recommendations my doctor made to me were 20 weight loss and to start taking metformin however, i am currently about 2 years into eating disorder recovery and intentional weight loss doesnt align with my goals in recovery, im just not willing to fall back into my eating disorder. my doctor also has not tested my a1c or confirmed in any way that i actually have insulin resistance, which judging by the consistent weight gain i have experienced, it is probable, but it just doesnt feel right to me that we have no numbers to back it up. after doing a lot of research, it seems that most people do not lose weight or have positive experiences taking metformin. i am currently taking inositolas i have seen studies that show it is as effective as metformin, vitamin d mine was very low, magnesium, nac, a daily probiotic, and multivitamin. if anyone knows of reliable supplement brands with a decent budget that would be appreciated as well pcos isnt cheap! i recently started working with a dietician rd that specializes in pcos and eating disorders, so i am hoping she will be able to provide me with more guidance, but ive been feeling really stressed about everything and would really appreciate hearing from anyone that is also trying to navigate a pcos diagnosis while in recovery. i would also love to know your supplement stack, experiences with metformininositol, or really any advice anyone has to offer have that has been helpful for them! tia 3",/r/PCOS/comments/192v3uv/navigating_pcos_and_ed_recovery/,3
Need to vent,"ive had such an emotional week. i went to my primary care doctor hoping to get some meds for my pcos. in this visit i didnt get much help and also had high blood pressure which ive never had before and was concerning. ive been trying the natural way for so long and im exhausted i wanted to see what my options were. i was really hoping she would prescribe metformin since i have chin hair and am overweight. she wouldnt prescribe anything to me and stated i need blood work for my hormones done and to go to an endocrinologist. ok i get that and i do need new bloodwork since its been years but i was just frustrated. then she wouldnt prescribe me wellbutrin and said id need to go to a psychiatrist. i was hoping the wellbutrin would be better for me because im on cymbalta and feel like it doesnt help much anymore and ive heard great things about wellbutrin on this sub. another thing to note is im trying to quit vaping and i know wellbutrin is good for that. she did prescribe me buspar for anxiety twice a day. idk if i like it yet. i still had trouble falling asleep and racing thoughts. fast forward to today i was feeling off and had the nurse at my work take my blood pressure im a therapist at a substance abuse treatment center. my blood pressure was even higher. i threw away my vape and hoping this will make the numbers go down. im feeling low self esteem right now due to all this. i know my diet has been crap and im not moving as much as i should. i do daily walks multiple times a day with my dog though so i think it is mainly stress, diet and vaping causing my blood pressure to be high. i also deal with chronic pain which is why im on cymbalta and its so exhausting dealing with pain and pcos. every time i do a workout low intensity even it triggers pain. i want to be more active but im so tired. i want to eat better but my cravings are so bad. im also in recovery so food has been my comfort for years and now i feel like i cant have that on top of my low mood tonight im dating someone new and told him i was having a rough night since we were texting. he went into full guy mode and was giving me advice on working out and how i should try fitness classes. hes super into fitness which is great for him but he doesnt know me well enough to be giving me advice. it ended up making me feel worse. it just all felt judgmental even if that wasnt his intention. i got the vibe he wants a girl who is super fit and thats just not me at the moment because of everything i have going on. he made a point to ask for a full body pic when we first started talking and i had full body pics on my hinge. i even called him out for it and said something like are you worried im fat and he said you said it. it made me really sad because i want to find a man who loves me for who i am and not my physical appearance. thanks for anyone who reads all of this. it was pretty cathartic to just type it all out. i have lots of supportive friends and a therapist myself but i know you all understand the struggle more",/r/PCOS/comments/1cyk4ne/need_to_vent/,3

"Amenorrhea, Lean PCOS, Post-Pill Recovery – My Journey So Far (Not TTC Yet) 31f","hi everyone. ive been lurking here for a long time and ive learned so much by reading posts. pcos feels very isolating much of the time. i havent seen much content that is exactly similar to my experience, so i wanted to post my own journey in case it helps someone else feel less alone. background im 31 years old and stopped the birth control pill in january 2025 after being on it for about 12 years. i likely had undiagnosed pcos since i was a teen i never had very regular cycles before the pill, in fact, by college it had become just amenorrhea. i went a long time probably around to 912 months without a period in college, which led me to start the pill at around 19 years old. i had been taking it ever since, assuming nothing was really wrong. after stopping the pill the beginning of this year january 2025, i went months with no natural bleed and was diagnosed with pcos in april 2025 based on bloodwork elevated testosterone and a 31 lhfsh ratio. my only noticeable symptoms have been irregular or absent cycles and occasional chinjawline acne. i had a 1 hour oral glucose tolerance test that came back normal it was actually on the low end of normal so i might ask my doctor about hyperinsulinemia. i also had a1c and thyroid normal from a routine physical the previous year. that, combined with my height 55 and steady weight fluctuating at 133140lbs with estimated 24 body fat led my doctor to conclude i dont have an insulin resistant pcos type. i dont have excessive body hair growth or excessive hair loss. dheas and shbg were normal as well. im not currently trying to conceive, but i want the option in the future, and want to maintain my health as best as possible. what ive implemented so far inositol, magnesium glycinate, zinc, a probiotic, and about to switch my multivitamin to a prenatal provera medroxyprogesterone as needed to avoid going too long without a bleed occasional cbd use at night for relaxation timelinemilestones so far jan 2025 last pill withdrawal bleed april 2025 diagnosed via bloodwork after 4 months no menstruation lownormal estradiol, high lh testosterone may 2025 proverainduced bleed june 18, 2025 first unmedicated bleed began after spotting for a few days likely anovulatory, but it still feels like a big deal! june 20, 2025 bloodwork cycle day 3 total testosterone still high, lhfsh still 31, but estradiol and progesterone showed a little upward movement what im trying to focus on supporting my mental health and stress journaling, mindfulness, and allowing grief around this process supporting my body to hopefully ovulate naturally preparing to speak with my doctor at the end of july about potential next steps like letrozole? if my cycles dont improve by the 12 month mark id love to hear from anyone else in a similar situation especially those with lean pcos, who are in postpill recovery, or who are not actively ttc but trying to learn about their bodies and ovulate. ill try to update or post again if i have any more milestones or knowledge that comes from labsdoctor visits. if you made it this far, thanks for being here and for reading.",/r/PCOS/comments/1lipq58/amenorrhea_lean_pcos_postpill_recovery_my_journey/,3
How do you do it?,"i have struggled with pcos for a while and live in a place where doctors do not recommend any treatment except lose weight. now, i struggle with sleep because i have really bad allergies and deviated septum had a septoplasty last week, still recovering. i am in a position where i have a cook, and i am going to work on having a proper sleep schedule gradually. however, every doctor has recommended diet and walking to me. i have tried hiit, weight training in the past and while i got slimmer, the scale never changed and so i gave up as my sleep got worse. now that im in recovery, gradually doing better and eating better. how do i start working out? does walking really help?",/r/PCOS/comments/1fya85c/how_do_you_do_it/,3
Return of symptoms after quitting BC among many other things,"hello everyone. i didnt know which flair to add to this so my bad if this doesnt quite fit. i just need advice on a bunch of different issues im currently experiencing. bit of a back story i was diagnosed with pcos at age 16. i was prescribed a combination pill and was on it for 7 years. i had to quit due to suddenly developing perioral dermatitis in 2019. i suffered from it for 9 months and eliminated lots of foods to combat the recurring breakoutsreduce inflammation, but nothing helped. as a last resort, i got off the pill last april and havent had a breakout since. i was asked to get my hormones tested on the second day of my second period off the pill, but due to financial troubles i had to postpone it to my next period, which never came. after coming off the pill, i had two periods, both were super late, but i was happy to see i got my period back straight away. my gynecologist had warned me that it might seem like i am back on track immediately after quitting, but we shouldnt get too excited as some people may experience irregularities later on. that is exactly what happened. my period is 49 days late as of now. i did get the tiniest amount of spotting like a drop when i was only 18 days late. its safe to say now that ive completely skipped my third period after coming off the pill. ok. now that i am done with that. my main issues are the gradual return of symptoms i had 7 years ago. hormonal acne is back. peach fuzz on my face is growing in slightly darker. my eyebrows need daily maintenance again and my body hair grows back faster too. the thing is, before coming off of birth control, id changed my diet drastically to treat my symptoms, because even when i was on the pill, id still get hormonal acne. the first two periods id had, i was still on a fairly lowcarb, gluten free, dairy free, refined sugar free, alcohol and caffeine free diet. but then i started getting help for anorexia and orthorexia thanks pcos for dramatically changing the way i view food for the worse and am now on a weight gain meal plan. i introduced gluten back into my diet as i wasnt sure if it quitting was doing anything for me and as a result i eat more carbs now in addition to eating more in general. now my questions can i still get my hormones checked if i am not on my period? could being on a caloric surplusgaining weight be causing my symptoms? i am still underweight so i might just be having amenorrhea due to that. i am also scared that now that i am gaining, i wont be able to stop or lose weight if i do end up gaining too much. ive been underweight all my life, so i dont know whether being in a normal weight range is going to make my symptoms worse. most people say gaining weight is the worse thing you can do for pcos. i dont know what to do. i dont know which problem to focus on. i am deeply overwhelmed. i cant go back to restrictingcontrolling my diet obsessively because then id be giving up on eating disorder recovery. but with my symptoms creeping back into my life, i dont know if im making my pcos worse. i just need advice in general. or comments. anything. has anyone had a similar experience? thank you for reading this far if you did, sorry for rambling so much. these thoughts have been consuming my life and i am truly at a point where i cant even function properly.",/r/PCOS/comments/jabkf5/return_of_symptoms_after_quitting_bc_among_many/,3
How to battle hip weight,"tw on ed i am 39 years old and was diagnosed with insulin resistant pcos at age 13. i am a short pear and i am overweight my scales were taken away for ed recovery, but based on clothing and measurements, i probably weigh around 235 atm. ive never been able to get under 215 lbs. i have been struggling my whole life with disordered eating, and have had a full on diagnosed eating disorder for the past 5 years. in the past 2 years specifically, i have been on a bingerestrict weight rollercoaster. 6 months of gaining 40 lbs, and then 6 months of losing 40 lbs two cycles of each. im on the last cycle of losing what i gained from ed recovery no i am not fully recovered, though i have learned some better habits to inhibit extreme restriction in the long run and each time this happens, it gets harder and harder to lose weight from my hips. my restrictive ed tends to mess up all of my hormones, especially insulin, cortisol, testosterone, estrogen, and t3t4. i have been able to heal several hormones after my last relapse and get back to losing what i gained during recovery. i quit if and now i eat three meals a day and avoid snacks to ensure my insulin remains stable. i have also gone from strict keto to a hormone balanced keto slightly higher net carbs through more nonstarchy vegetables. i have lost a ton from my waist, abdomen, thighs, and arms. my stupid hips are slowly going away but not as fast as in the past. those are the target of my body dysmorphia so i fixate on them but they just need to go, and i cant make it happen. i go for power walks three days a week, each session between 3 and 4 miles at about 4mph, and one day of cycling for 40 miles at 1213 mph. so i get a good 89 hours of cardioresistancehiit per week i integrate all three exercise types into the power walking and riding by adding in steep hills, rough terrain, sprint cycling, and jogging intervals during walking. is it possible to target hip fat, or is that just something that will come off when it wants to come off? im sure estrogen dominance does not help, though i am on progesterone replacement therapy. i have a classic pear shape with my hips being 10 inches larger than my waist. its quite frustrating and i feel so self conscious and misshapen.",/r/PCOS/comments/17rgso3/how_to_battle_hip_weight/,3
Update after my BSO Hysterectomy,"so many in here will remember ive been on a bit of a journey. last update i posted was that i would be having my surgery november 18th. the surgery happened as scheduled and it went really well. they were actually able to do it robotic assisted which is, from what im told, the best option. they removed everything but decided against the lymph nodes as they felt there wasnt a true need to remove them based on what they saw. they did end up finding grade 1 stage 1 endometrial cancer and a 2 inch tumor. they said it was within the lining and hadnt gotten into the uterine wall yet. its crazy though because i had that dc in august and nothing was seen, though i am going to ask my obgyn if that would have even been possible for her to have seen. they did also find my left ovary had the cysts, from pcos, on it but also a spot that they said could have been endometriosis or something else. they werent 100 sure on that. but they said they got everything out. they arent requiring any treatment, just have go in for testing every 6 months for the next 5 years. recovery wise ive been doing great. i only stayed overnight in the hospital and that was more because as i was waking up from anesthesia i would doze back off and my oxygen went low so they had me on some but by like 67pm they took it off of me. i cant say enough for the nurses at karmanos. they were amazing. they were attentive and kind. and the food was so good! normally you hear horror stories about hospital food but no lie it was really good. im still on restrictions until my follow up on jan 9th where theyll check to make sure everything is all closed up from where they removed the cervix. then i will hopefully be able to take a bath again. pcos wise the only thing ive really noticed is that the facial hair seems to not be growing as fast. i know itll take time for things to calm down. i go to my endocrinologist in april and im hoping to do some hormone testing to see if i can get things more evened out, if possible. other than that just trying to deal with the mental aspect of things and the factor of being called a cancer survivor. some days im fine, other days i cant even watch cute videos with babies in them. today a client, who got everything mixed up and thought i was having a baby and not surgery, asked if i had the baby and i didnt think it would hurt me that much but i ended up having a breakdown after getting off the phone with him. but i know each day will get easier and i am beyond thankful that it was found and its all gone.",/r/PCOS/comments/zr2gay/update_after_my_bso_hysterectomy/,3
How do you do it? How do you learn to love yourself?,"i dont know if this violates rule 4, and i went so far as to make a new account because im so scared of myself and in denial but here we go. also i hope mental health is the right flair. wall of text on mobile, but then again no one is probably going to read it, but its nice to journal into the void a bit. this is a question ive been struggling with for a very long time. i guess you could say im new to a semipcos diagnosis, but its not my first rodeo with womens health problems. ill set the scene, im a 23f whos got a medical history so long and complicated it looks like the case notes they give med students for tests. i think the only body system i dont have something wrong with me is neurology. from a gynaecology point of view, i got my period when i was 12, i bleed heavily, irregular, horrific pain, family history of endometriosis, so we were on the oral bc wagon pretty quickly. ive been on back to back for probably 10 years. i had an iud put in when i was 16 because i was part of the international program in school and would be traveling, and honestly it was a godsend to not have to take another medication. i had to have it replaced early 1.5 years ish because i started to get bleeds even on oral bc. it was okay, where i lived at the time respected that it would be better to have it done under ga as it would cause less backlash from my body and a quicker recovery. got a bacterial blood infection from the hospital, but aside from that it was a smooth change over. this time we decided to keep me on oral bc as a precaution. fast forward a few years, and things start getting weird. id like to say i was one of the very lucky few who didnt get side effects from bc. no weight gain, no mood changes, nothing. i really lucked out. i was given a psychiatric medication incorrectly malpractice and gained weight rapidly, stopped the medication. it settled and while i didnt lose the weight and accepted i would have to work for it, it had settled. go forward a few months and slowly but surely i was gaining weight. to date over 18 months, ive gained 20kg on top of the additional gain from the meds with no explanation, and its continues now. ive had no changes in medication, ive had minimal lifestyle changes any changes that have occurred happened after it was noticed, and ive been stuck with in a holding pattern with specialists. my gynae is an absolute gem he was the one who brought me into this world and is surprisingly still practicing and he has done everything in his power to make sure im at least comfortable with pain management, and regular scans to check for cysts i had one removed in the past. i tried endocrine since the tests were lining up with cushings disease, but was dismissed by the doctor and given the suggestion to drop all of my medications and treatment to see if it improved my weight. gynae and psych both scoffed at the suggestion and sent her on her way. i started getting male pattern hair growth. by pcos standards it was minimal, but it was definitely a noticeable change to me fair skinned with blonde hair to looking like i had mens leg hair and a mo. the body shape i was taking to was clinically normal for cushingspcos. the massive pack across my stomach, tuck shop arms. im covered in constantly newly forming stretch marks. i was getting to the end of my rope because although i had a good support from my gynae and my psychiatrist, things werent changing, my gp was dismissive and still is and im struggling. i overstepped one session and suggested looking at my hormone balances, to which gynae agreed. tests came back. i have no fsh, no sign of premenopause, but elevated testosterone. at the same time i had a scan showing i had small cysts forming, but without fsh. finally, an answer. probable pcos, but basically dormant due to how well ive had my bc managed throughout my life, and probably dormant endo as well. theyre probably there but theyve never had a chance to form. the raised t is probably the only symptom showing through, which in turn has messed with my weight. the only way we could get a definitive diagnosis would be for me to be off bc for a long period of time, which in terms of my health is not possible and probably wont be until i decide to have children. we started with some spironolactone to see if theres some fluid retention, to try and get the t under control and to help with the hair growth. so i have an answer, finally, but i still feel no better in myself. i never had a lot of self worth of self confidence to begin with, but it was never like this. i cant deal with the sensation of my new rolls of fat rubbing together or moving, i end up having suicidal thoughts when having to buy new clothes. i stopped using my wardrobe because i cant bring myself to throw out all the old clothes i still yearn to fit into and feel remotely confident in. i cant look in the mirror without having irrational thoughts, its even gotten to the point where i dont shower as often as i should or even would like to because i cant stand to see myself. im lucky in the fact i have a supportive boyfriend, who despite me refusing, showers me with compliments and loves me for me, but i just cant love myself. so my question is, how do i do it? i want to be able to accept myself and to try and feel pretty with what i have hopefully temporary, but i just cant, i have no sense of self, and i feel so disconnected from what i currently am and what i used to be. i dont really have anyone else to talk to about it, and the few people in my social circle i want to reach out to i dont know how to, because i dont want to be rude or offensive to them. i just dont know what to do, and its just a brick in the jenga of my mental health that i need to fix fast, or the introduction of probable arthritis will probably rip me over. if you guys can offer advice, please help me. disclaimer at the end i realise that i havent included much on my mental health. i am actively being monitored and treated for environmental depression and anxiety, and it is flaring. all the medication im on are 5 year stints, and theyre all weight neutral, hence my psych telling people to stay in their lane. i practice mindfulness and some dbt activities, which basically renders therapy a bit pointless since i already practice the teachings i just hope that people might have similar stories, and that they might have advice on how they accepted pcos into their lives.",/r/PCOS/comments/hjvowg/how_do_you_do_it_how_do_you_learn_to_love_yourself/,3

History of eating disorder and developed PCOS,i recently got diagnosed with pcos after labs and ultrasound. i gained more weight as well which made me suspicious. the problem is my history. i have a long history of anorexia. i was never underweight but still lost a significant amount of weight and had to enter treatment several times. my most recent recovery attempt resulted in more weight gain than i expected and i gained even more after that. then the pcos symptoms started. i weigh more than i ever have 52 175 lb. i try to eat relatively healthy and exercise is difficult because i work night shift and go to school full time. i had a couple weeks of undereating and punishing exercise. basically i cant seem to try to lose weight without falling into the ed trap again. im starting oral contraceptives soon and im scared ill just gain more. i just want to know if anyone has been through this. rapid weight loss almost always triggers ed behaviors for me. it is not healthy. im not sure what to do because it seems that i cant lose unless i starve myself.,/r/PCOS/comments/1ll6j46/history_of_eating_disorder_and_developed_pcos/,3
Diet Help/Advice: How do you control anxious eating? And what swapouts have you found helpful in your diet?,"i 23yo f was recently diagnosed with pcos. my symptoms are cysts, elevated androgens, rapid weight gain and inability to lose it despite exercising like a maniac, facialchest hair, insomnia, severe anxiety and irregularheavy periods. its taken me 2 years to find a doctor that believed me and i am currently on metformin as i am unable to take birth control i am at a high risk of blood clots and no doctor is willing to take the risk of me getting a stroke. i have found the metformin is helping enormously with my eating. i am currently only eating a third of what i normally would as i just dont get hungry anymore. however, i am really wanting to make some hard and fast diet changes to help speed up my weight lossrecovery from this shit, because quite frankly i should be 20kg lighter than i am! i am after advice. so far i figure the big no nos are starchyprocessed foods potatoes, white rice, pastriescakes, pasta, bread, alcohol. my issue is willpower... i wont actively go out and buy those foods myself, but if they are put in front of me in a social setting i feel pressured to eat them. i suffer from anxiety very, very badly i think as part of the pcos to the degree that i feel people will attack me if they make eye contact and was wondering if anyone else here did as well, if it was linked to their eating, and if they had anything helpful that they saiddid to stop themselves from making bad eating choices? secondly, interested in peoples opinions on teas to help with pcos seems like spearmint and green are the way to go?? dairy? and what about porridge? do people have a goto mylk alternative that they use, and why? also wondering what people replaced white rice with. im mad for indian foodcurries and rice has always been a staple of mine. would love to hear peoples alternatives.",/r/PCOS/comments/p6fhvc/diet_helpadvice_how_do_you_control_anxious_eating/,3
BIRTH CONTROL HELP!!! :(,"please read all! tw ed hello! im new to pcos reddit and this is my first post here!! im a 20 yo who also suffers from pcos, but i do not currently have any cysts on my ovaries or have had any in the past. i have extra hair especially on my face and experienced rapid weight gain, horrible depression and anxiety, and heavy periods that would last for 24 weeks in the past. i was diagnosed back in 2017 when i gained 80 lbs in a year and weighed about 226. before i gained weight, i was anorexic and went from eating once a week for two months to suffering from binge eating. i originally attributed the weight gain to my eds and they definitely played a role, but it was mostly from the pcos i was told. i am still in recovery from my eds. im mentioning this for later. recently i started dating my boyfriend and all ive wanted to do is jump his bones lol. however, the birth control pills im taking nikki brand absolutely make me dry as a desert. now, before anyone jumps to any other conclusions i already switched to a pill with a little less estrogen. i was horny as hell, but i couldnt stop bleeding!!!! i attributed it to normal spotting when you switch pills, but my periods werent evening out after 3 months and i was back to 2 week periods. ive tried other brands before, but none of them would work consistently and switched almost every 6 months until i was prescribed nikki in december of 2018. i want to try another method! what i really want is a hormonal iud. ive seen a lot of people on here talk about how the iud can inflame your ovaries and make pcos worse. ive seen people saying the shots make you gain weight or dont really work. since i am in recovery, my biggest goal overall is to not trigger my ed. i want to avoid gaining weight because i am at a healthy weight for my body now 155 finally after 4 years and do not want to fall into bad habits again because i see myself gaining, which i believe would also be bad for my bodily health outside of my eds!! ive never gained weight on the birth control pills i took because it regulates my hormones and i was also prescribed 500mg of metformin not one of the brands that has recently been recalled thankfully which ive been taking since 2017. please reply with your advice! im going to make a gyno appointment, but i was hoping to hear from other peoples experiences! thank you!!! tldr should i be prepared for weight gain if i get an iud? what is the best alternative to pills for pcos? would you recommend anything else or that i stay on the pills and try another brand?",/r/PCOS/comments/hct346/birth_control_help/,3
Have you been told you’re high risk for Type II Diabetes because you have a diabetic parent or grandparent?,"my weight inclusive doctor just informed me that if that parent or grandparent was exposed to agent orange during the vietnam warresistance war against america your fate may not be set in stone and your assumed genetic predisposition to diabetes might not be a reality. veterans in the us exposed to agent orange are now eligible for disability compensation. why does this matter? because when most healthcare providers see an elevated bmi and pcos classification on our charts they are obligated by insurance companies here in the us to counsel us about weight loss and scare us about diabetes. reminder your pcp or your obgyns are not endocrinologists or registered dietitians. my weight inclusive doctor has been doing the work with me. shes analyzed every test result ive had for the last decade, at varying sizes between a us 4 and a us 20 and at various stages of my restrictive ed and recovery. shes cross referenced them with current fasting and nonfasting blood tests and after my last visit, her patient summary stated not diabetic, no signs of insulin resistance. yall, my dad died at the age of 59 after losing toes, almost losing his legs, losing teeth, and ultimately experiencing kidney failure due to his advanced agent orange induced type ii diabetes. if youre like me and youve spent years of your life punishing yourself because you didnt want to end up like a loved one who may have been in the same boat as my dad, i suggest you take this information to your doctor and ask them to look into it further. the va has resources about the pact act that also detail other illnesses related to other places folks might have served on their website. for example, my sister has reoccurring skin cancer and thyroid issues related to her service in the middle east. i can likely cross thyroid off the list of things that keep me up at night.",/r/PCOS/comments/11b07ol/have_you_been_told_youre_high_risk_for_type_ii/,3
Lean PCOS and EDs,"hey folx, brief mention of an ed but no mention of habits i have had irregular periods for most of my teens and early twenties, and went multiple years without a period from 18 23 due to struggling with anorexia, which i have had since i was 14. at the time i was also diagnosed with hypothalamic amenorrhea. after lots of recovery work, i have finally gotten up to a healthy weight and have been menstruating again, but my periods are fairly irregular. after some abnormal bleeding and spotting in june i decided to finally see a doctor again and got blood work done, as well as an intravag ultrasound. doctor found cysts! however, he said my hormone and a1c levels were normal. i have read that hypothalamic amenorrhea can be commonly misdiagnosed as pcos as they both present ovarian cysts and can cause menstrual irregularities. i am just really anxious because i have reached a good period of remission and i think that focusing on eating a proper pcos diet will lead me to disordered eating habits again. so much of pcos treatment is based in diet culture it feels like. dont get me wrong, i eat healthily and am very active, but i do have treats occasionally and it took a long time for me to reach a point where i could eat fun foods without freaking out, especially added sugars. has anyone been in this same boat?",/r/PCOS/comments/w9yu9s/lean_pcos_and_eds/,3

Thyroid disguised under PCOS,"since i got my period when i was 12, they were a bit irregular. they started off irregular but for 45 years things were fine till i was 1516. i was a very active kid and used to play basketball regularly but this one time i got an ankle injury for which i was on very little movement for 2 months and suddenly gained over 1520 kgs which was insane to me. no matter what i did it was very difficult to lose weight. i got diagnosed with pcos was given the so called hormonal pills and life was going on. during covid i started calorie tracking and lost weight only when i developed a legit eating disorder and couldnt eat more than 1300. i did lose 1013 kgs of weight just to put it back even more quickly. my periods kind of got lost and i had no clue what to do, but i always continued gymming after my injury recovery even though i couldnt lose much weight. only recently i got the pcos panel tests againmy tsh and prolactin levels were a bit high and on consulting the doctor she told that i need to take thyroid medicines on low doses and continue living a healthy lifestyle along with starting a gluten free diet. she said the hormones have the chance to get regulated and reverse in 36 months and then we can start to taper the doses. ngl guys i can see the change in a month! the weighing scale that wasnt even moving a bit is now showing alot of changes per week n it just feels so relieving. two weeks after starting the meds i even got my periods back. so please keep getting tested every 6 months at the least or anytime you feel your body is shutting down.",/r/PCOS/comments/1lmpjgq/thyroid_disguised_under_pcos/,2

Getting A PCOS Diagnosis,"tw for eating disorders im having an extremely difficult time at the moment because of this. i 19f went to the endocrinologist today with my mother to see about a pcos diagnosis. some background i had my first ovarian cyst rupture when i was about 1213 and ive been on a combo birth control pill ever since with no breakssugar pills. i have been overweight almost my whole life and i developed an eating disorder because of this. my mother has a bad relationship with food and it was thrust upon me from a young age that being in a bigger body was something that was shameful, even though most of the women around me are about my size in my family. ive gone to nutritionists and never lose any weight with them. i do have insulin resistance, which my wonderful primary np helped me confirm. i am currently 190 pounds. so today, i had an appointment with endocrinology to try to get a pcos diagnosis and see what i could do from there. it was a massive waste of my time. i have an appointment with a gyn that keeps getting pushed back because of her schedule, so i decided to try endocrine. basically, he told me that there was nothing he could do and that i just needed to lose weight. i had shared that i had struggled with an eating disorder earlier in the appointment. to my mother and my embarrassment, i burst into tears. i had tried to lose weight for so long and no matter how little i ate and how much i exercised, the weight barely budged. i left the appointment feeling like i had gone back three steps in my ed recovery. my mother, no matter how many times i tell her otherwise, always thinks i was a binge eater because she is. the whole appointment was basically just me crying while they told me i needed to lose weight over and over again and that i should think of this as a good thing because, in my mothers words you need to lose 50 pounds, its not like its 100. the appointment was about an hour away and the whole time home it was just constant talk about her appointments with her nutritionist and what she thinks i need to do. ive told her so many times that calorie tracking is a gateway to relapsing for me. i just need advice on where to go from here. i have an appointment with my moms nutritionist coming up and a gyn appointment in september. i am just feeling so discouraged and the feeling of almost relapsing is so persistent in my head. any advice for someone whos discouraged after a notsohelpful doctors appointment? or even words of encouragement? also, please tell me if im overreacting. i know i need to lose weight but it was such an unhelpful experience in my opinion. he did order labs for cushings testing and hormone levels but it was basically youre already on the pill i cant help you past that",/r/PCOS/comments/15fu3vt/getting_a_pcos_diagnosis/,2
Waiting to see if cyst will rupture or go away?,"tldr have two cysts on right ovary. er doc said to wait and see if it bursts or goes away. is this good advice? i was diagnosed with pcos when i was 15 37 now. in that time, ive had a few cysts burst and its one of the most painful things ive ever experienced. fast forward, i had a hysterectomy in november. my doc left my ovaries, but removed several cysts and tumors off of them. since the surgery, ive been having constant pelvic pain, but chalked that up to typical recovery. the last few weeks, ive been having abdominal pain. my gi doc ruled out crohns flare up or obstruction or anything viralbacterial, so sent me to er for a ct scan and ultrasound. everything came back fine, except they found two hemorrhagic cysts on right ovary. one of them about 1.5 inches. im not sure about the left ovary because apparently they couldnt find it at all? anyway. the er dr told me that this was likely the cause of the pain ive been having, but to wait and see if it goes away or if it bursts. and if it bursts, to come in right away so they can manage the pain and make sure i dont experience any internal bleeding. i asked about just taking care of them now so i dont have to worry about going through all of that, but he brushed me off and told me surgery was more dangerous right now than waiting. he also said that these were likely new cysts since my hysterectomy and that they can grow pretty rapidly because they are literally filling with blood as we speak. i put a call in to my obgyn but havent heard back yet. this morning, im having lower right back pain in addition to the stomach pain thats fairly uncomfortable. im assuming its the cyst, but with all my numerous other issues, i cant be 100 certain. im wondering if the er doc is correct in just taking pain meds and waiting it out? or with this new pain today, would you consider it worth going back in? ive already done tylenolibuprofen combo w little improvement. but i dont want to spend another 10 hours in the er for nothing again. report right ovary 3.8 x 2.8 x 5.2 cm. cystic 3.7 x 3.3 x 3.5 cm lesion with reticulations and low level internal echoes suggestive of a hemorrhagic cyst. smaller hypoechoic, avascular 1.4 x 1.0 x 1.5 cm lesion.",/r/PCOS/comments/10oazi1/waiting_to_see_if_cyst_will_rupture_or_go_away/,2

Hello everyone. This is my first post.,"i was diagnosed with pcos about 6 years ago. ive been dealing with all of the symptoms since my 20s. my mother had it bad along severe endometriosis. she also had an issue with her surgeon leaving part of her ovary in and ended up being positive for ovarian cancer. luckily they got it out and cleared her margins so she was good. im seeing a new gyn. i like her very much and she is very thorough. i had a large cyst burst on my left ovary last month. it had me bent over in pain. im 45 years old so we started to discuss removing my ovaries or getting a hysterectomy. when i first started spoke to her, it looked like we were leaning towards a partial. i had genetic testing done and did not have any markers. i also had an endometrial biopsy this week. when i went in for the procedure, she said after thinking about it for a while, she was leaning towards a radical hysterectomy. i was kind of taken back because i thought we were waiting on a few other things in order to go in that direction. my wife is a nurse and has a lot of questions as to why we would go with a radical one instead of just removing my ovaries. with no genetic markers, and if my biopsy comes back fine, we both are not clear as to why we go in that direction. my doctors only reasoning at this point is because of my mothers history. i have no other symptoms except for pcos issues. im having unexplained pain in my left flank where my cyst burst. the other concern is endometriosis, but shes not going to be able to tell until she goes in there for any type of surgery. has anyone had a similar situation? going from just removing my ovaries to a major surgery is a lot to consider. i also still have schoolage children and work fulltime so the recovery a 4 to 6 weeks is a concern to me. i appreciate your input .",/r/PCOS/comments/1ehhh4b/hello_everyone_this_is_my_first_post/,2

PCOS symptoms but doctors not concerned,"im 23f. i had my first period when i was 13 but developed anorexia at the same time. i started recovery and got it back at 14 for about a month, then it never came back again since i was in a constant recoveryrelapse cycle. i have very oily skin and as a teen i had normal teenage acne but it was wellcontrolled with a benzoyl peroxide face wash. i also have a strong family history of cystic acne my dad, cousins, etc. i also have mild keratosis pilaris if that matters. when i was 19 i started the minipill for protection. my gyno also stated in my chart that my lack of periods was most likely due to amenorrhea. stayed on that for two years while still using a bp wash, hardly any acne. i went off the pill and developed very painful cystic acne concentrated on my cheeksjaw area, but also some on my forehead i had also switched to a nonbp face wash when this happened. i eventually started using the bp wash again and slowly my acne totally went away. it was kept under control until the bp wash was discontinued. my acne came back but this time in the form of a lot of clogged pores and what looked like fungal acne. skin was extremely oily and this is when i noticed i had dark hair on my upper link and some on my neck. went to a different gyno i had pluckedused a face razor on the hair and told her everything she put me on a different birth control. i also went to a dermatologist who said my acne looked hormonal. currently my acne is very wellmanaged with epiduo forte and yaz birth control. i still get black, thick hairs on my upper lip and neck not like a beard, i have like 68 neck hairs, maybe 6 lip hairs, and one random cheek hair...hard to tell but my mother says she had all of that too and she does not have pcos as far as she knows. my skin and hair are very oily still. no natural period whenever ive taken breaks from the pill i asked another gyno and she said it was most likely due to low bmi. i have no issue losing weight. i do have some insulin issues in the form of genetic reactive hypoglycemia my mom and her mom havehad the same thing but doctors are not concerned. anyway, so with all that being said, i am confused as to why doctors dont think i could have pcos. i mean, if i did have it, im already on the pill which should help. but im terrified if i ever have to go off of it that i would get more facial hair, the cystic acne would come back, etc. is it really possible this is all normal and just due to my genetics and eating disorder history? i brought up possible pcos to a gyno and she said if we tested hormones id have to go off the pill...i am so scared to do that so i said never mind. after i said that she reassured me that likely that was not an issue and staying on the pill was safest to reduce cancer risks associated with amenorrhea.",/r/PCOS/comments/13xd69e/pcos_symptoms_but_doctors_not_concerned/,2
My journey,"well it al started when my mom met my dad and they had me lol jk. i wanted to make things more light hearted. i moved from mexico city to california about 9 yrs ago on june 2013. by january of 2014 my period was taking longer to come till by march it had been 2 months without it. i got scared and since it was a new place, country and language i didnt say anything until my mom found that i hadnt used any pads for my period and started asking me if i was pregnant really?. she took me to the doctor along with my stepdad. i was told to just lose weight and itll get better. that was in may of 2014, i was graduating from 12th grade and going to community college and it was then when my hell began. by july of 2014 my period came back 28 days to the dot. it was normal more abundant than it used to and my december of 2014 i started with little pinchen on my back or my pelvis. then my right or left side around the pelvis area and i thought it was normal even though i never had that kind of pain when i had my period before it went away. each time i brought the pain to my doctors they would send me to get an ultrasound and they told me i had nothing that it was just cramps till i changed doctors. the new doctor sent another ultrasound 4 in a span of a year and by 2015 i was told i had a 1.2 cm cyst in my right ovary. the doctor took a good 1.5 hrs on top of my appointment to tell me after that just take tylenol or ibuprofen one week prior to your period. the freaking issue was my period was still irregular. i could go 28333040 days between periods and i thought that if every time that was going to happen i wasnt going to waste my time and i stopped going to the doctor and sucking up the pain from 2015 till 2022. in 2022 we changed insurance and we got a new doctor. actually and np who listened to our concerns and the first thing she did what a full physical exam. and she sent me to get an ultrasound 5 or 6 by then idk. that cyst other doctors wouldnt act on and see what was going on was then 2.2 cm. when she told me that she referred me to and obgyn who at the moment i had my first appointment with him and told him all what had happened and what they told me to do for they pain he was angry. he even told me that if i had developed a tube twist that could had been way worst. two months later i got a laparoscopic surgery to remove the cyst and ho surprise! it was not 1 or 2 but 5 cysts and 50 ml of adhesive tissue in my uterus. the recovery from the anesthesia was funny because i woke up humming christmas carols in august lol. they pump you up with gas to see better and trying to get the air out is awful. i can say that after that my np sent me to get a full hormonal panel and saw my low iron a bit of anemia and my testosterone up. she sent me to the endocrinologist and i tell him again all my story. he nods and tells me you have pcos. and i smiled and i tell him that i had been doing research and i was between pcos or endometriosis. at this point am on medication for hirsutism and my insulin resistance. its hard because now im starting to get those pinces and back pain again and i think is my left ovary. i got a new ultrasound today and im waiting for the results to come back and my doctor to check with my and see whats up. also, at this point im getting ready to apply for medical school because this experience got me thinking about all the pain we go through and that there are not many doctors who actually listen and ill like to make a change and help others like us to get the right treatment for this illness. remember that youre not alone.",/r/PCOS/comments/12rdgwr/my_journey/,2
"Advice/Insight Appreciated: Not Insulin Resistant, Now Maybe Off BC?","hi all! i was diagnosed with pcos 15 years ago. at the time, i was lean and muscular with a very small amount of downy blonde hair down my abdomen and lower back so, physically, i didnt show any signs of pcos my endo used to show me to her students lol. ultrasound showed the classic string of pearls around my ovaries and i had high testosterone. id also never had a period but, in retrospect, i was anorexic and eating less than 1,000 calories per day back then i guess i didnt realize you could be a healthy weight and still have an ed. i was immediately put on a huge dose of metformin and a hormonal birth control pill. i was sick all the time from the metformin dizzy and blacking out if i didnt eat constantly needed a snack roughly every 2 hours, vomiting regularly, loose stool every fucking day, and i started gaining a ton of weight. it was pure misery. last year, my new gyn took me off the metformin because ive never had high blood sugar or a1c. i gain weight around my midsection but even half of a 750 metformin er would send my blood sugar plummeting to the point where i couldnt drive to work because id black out. she had zero qualms about taking me off and i sure as heck didnt fight her. i feel so much better now that i am off of it! i am, however, worried that i may have fucked up how my body operates after being on 15502000mg of metformin for 15 years. has anyone experienced this or heard anything about it? am i just overly anxious i mean, i do have gad hahaha. i am considering getting my rmr tested. in light of my recent realization that i was anorexic as a child and teenager, im also planning on going off the pill for a little while just to see if i can have a period now that i eat a normal range of calories. im also 34 so id kind of like to explore fertility testing and seeing if that is even an option for me at some point. and part of me is concerned about what sort of lasting effects i may have just by nature of having been on the pill consistently from the ages of 19 to 34. im also really hoping that maybe, just maybe, it will help with some weight loss. i feel like i have tried everything and i just cant stop being 100 lbs heavier than i was when i was diagnosed. its so frustrating! i eat a mostly vegetarian diet, i keep my calories in a healthy range, i try not to eat junk food but im also in ed recovery, so if i eat cookies, so be it. sometimes i just need the dopamine in a famous amos cookie lol. i exercise cardio, yoga, weights. labwork from my annual physical is always good. bp is good. i have adhd and hashimotos which complicates things but, holy mackerel am i ready to be 150 175 again im 59! edit i also didnt experience any hair loss on my head until after i started pcos treatment. i used to have such lovely thick hair! has anyone else seen weight loss benefits after coming off of the pill? anyone else been on metformin despite not being ir and what did you experience going off of it? honestly, sometimes, i feel like such a pcos weirdo i wonder if i was misdiagnosed. itd be great to connect with people in a similar boat. and its always nice to connect with people who know more than me bring on the scientific papers!",/r/PCOS/comments/o9qle6/adviceinsight_appreciated_not_insulin_resistant/,2

"recently diagnosed, need advice","hi, im usually a lurker but after some thought iv decided to post here, im looking for some advice and dont really know where to start. im 17 years old and was just recently diagnosed with pcos. it was a shock to me as i dont really exhibit many of the symptoms except that ive only had 3 periods since i was 13, and i guess my body hair grows a lot faster and darker in comparison to my friends but its never been a problem, same with weight gain. anyway my gp put me on birth control rigevidon as she explained its important that i have a regular cycle and im a but unsure of her exact wording for this but she also says something along the lines of regular menstruating being helpful in preventing or removing cysts i have as they could potentially turn cancerous if left. this part is what confuses me. im unaware of exactly how many cysts i have but they have never once caused me any pain or discomfort, unless the extreme back pain i experienced during 2 out of my 3 periods that left me unable to walk are related to them somehow? im relatively clueless on this subject so sorry if i sound ridiculous, haha. its been a week since ive been on birth control, and already i can tell its having a significant impact on my mood. in the past i dealt with mental health problems however this year i had finally been making great progress in recovery and have felt happy and content with living for days and weeks on end. i cant describe how amazing a general sense of wellbeing feels after years of living in a depressive fog!! the past few days, however, iv been overly emotional, bursting into tears, feeling extremely irritated over small things and i even had a panic attack for the first time since 2015 last night. the pit in my chest is exactly like the constant overarching feeling i lived with for years and the thought of having to deal with it all over again is heartbreaking honestly, i feel like all my progress will be for nothing. iv read that birth control can worsen underlying mental health issues and i just dont want to deal with it. would it be unsafe for me to stop taking the pill for this reason? or should i continue to because of pcos? i was quite fine with never having to deal with a period monthlylmao who wouldnt beand as i says i havent had to deal with any pcos symptoms that the pill could help with. my mum deals with similar mood and hormonal problems so i really should of seen this coming. im trying to keep a positive outlook but knowing my mood problems are happening because of something out of my control isnt helping",/r/PCOS/comments/6r92cl/recently_diagnosed_need_advice/,2

Recovering from ovary torsion,"i was diagnosed with pcos at 13. had scans, told my cysts were larger than most but birth control would help them shrink and manage them. im now 21, i spent 6 years on birth control and hated every single moment. lost myself, relationships, and everything in between. after getting off of birth control, i went to many different gynos trying to find an alternate approach that didnt make me a raging bitch. no additional scans ordered, no one ever listened, took me seriously. it was always blamed on my weight gain. being told i was fat and should lose a few pounds and maybe theyd go away. im a very athletic and healthy person, who struggles to lose the weight i gained while on bc, due to my pcos, ive literally tried everything i lived with it. i had no other choice. last weekend i was rushed to the er for excruciating lower abdominal pain presumed to be appendicitis. nope. turns out i had a 24cm cyst on my right ovary and my ovary had torsioned. at 21 i lost my right ovary due to negligence of multiple doctors over the years. it took 8 years to get another scan, and only because i ended up getting a ct scan for appendicitis. this is crazy to me. anyways, i had a great surgeon, and a great team of physicians, however the recovery guidelines were lackluster. to anyone else who has lost a single ovary, how was recovery for you, any change in fertility, sex drive, how long were you out? im hoping to find someone who has a similar experience or atleast understands what im facing. no one in my life gets it and i feel like im talking to walls.",/r/PCOS/comments/11tulat/recovering_from_ovary_torsion/,2

Ovary removal and fertility. Can anyone relate?,"can anyone relate to my story? what was your experience like? hope? in january, i went to the er for abdominal pain and vomiting. i had a super bad kidney infection the month prior and assumed what i was experiencing was related. the er performed a ct and found a complex, 10cm ovarian cyst. it was a complete surprise. in hindsight, it shouldnt have been. i brushed off so many symptoms as just normal woman stuff. because of the pain and the fear of rupture or torsion, my doctor recommended surgery. my sister has had a nightmarish experience with ovarian cysts. i witnessed the pain she experienced and it terrified me. so that being said, i agreed to surgery. fast forward to april, my doctors performed laparoscopic surgery. once inside, the doctors discovered my situation is far worse than they expected. the cyst encompassed my entire ovary and there was no way to salvage it. so they removed my ovary. recovery was hell including infection and abscesses. i needed another procedure to drain the first, very large abscess. this past week, i went to hospital very sick assuming my surgical infection has returned or not completley gone away. the er performed a ct and discovered many small cysts on my remaining ovary. the largest cyst measures about 2.5cm. i am on birth control now i wasnt before but my doctor said it wont treat the 2.5cm cyst. that means it can possibly grow as large as my previous cyst or hopefully not. i know its not horribly big but im really scared it will grow as big as my other cyst. i am scared of losing my last ovary. since i had a horrible recovery, i am scared of needing surgery again. my sister has gone through the same exact thing. she lost both ovaries to giant cysts in about 2 years. the only difference being that she was much older than i am and had already started a family. i am only 22 years old and i dream of being pregnant and having children. i was just diagnosed with pcos today. im so scared, hopeless, and heartbroken. can anyone else relate? whats your story? i would love to hear 3. tldr one ovary remains and has multiple cysts. scared of infertility.",/r/PCOS/comments/153d0ne/ovary_removal_and_fertility_can_anyone_relate/,1

Anyone recovering post-Metformin use? Help!,"im wondering if anyone here has had to quit metformin due to awful gi side effects, and what has your digestive recovery looked like. for reference, i quit metformin about two weeks ago after being on it 56 months. i was on a very low dose of metformin cream for helping to manage my pcos symptoms. i used the cream form to avoid the digestive upset because i have a veeery sensitive system. my microbiome has been troubled ever since dealing with chronic low stomach acid. the lotion was going great at first. after using it for 23 months, however, i started developing increasingly bad digestive symptoms that ive never had before. my doctor thinks the lotion had a delayed reaction as it built up potency in my system over time. my symptoms have been very much like bile acid malabsorption bam. i started having severe episodes after eating fatty meals especially. my bms were always soft, fiery feeling, and green or yellow in color. then it became full on diarrhea over time. also, after i would apply the lotion, i would feel a pretty immediate reaction in my gut. lots of gurgles, gas, and painful bms. i came across a science article called metformin and the gastrointestinal tract that explains what could be going on. its pretty interesting, but a bit over my head. it states in the article the efficacy of metformin is in part mediated by the gut potentially by direct effects on glucose update and metabolism, by directly or indirectly increasing glp1, by an increase in bile acid exposure and by altering the microbiome. desperate for relief, i gave up and stopped using metformin a couple of weeks ago. everything in my gut calmed down for a couple of days, but has since ramped up again. i no longer feel like im improving. i really hope whatever damage was done can be resolved soon. im not looking for a way to go back on metformin, as it just isnt a fit for me. but i am curious if others have had this experience and what their recovery has been like. did anything help you in particular other than giving it time? for the record... i think metformin is great for those who benefit from it and can tolerate it. it just isnt for me, unfortunately.",/r/PCOS/comments/1dekqpg/anyone_recovering_postmetformin_use_help/,1

Keeping Keto for PCOS & IF even in ED Recovery,"in my teens and 20s i had compulsive overeating disorder. i was 500 lbs and type 2 diabetic as well as every other pain and illness that goes along with being that level overweight. through all of those years i tried low carb diets and eliminating just sugar desserts and sweets, and nothing really worked. i embraced the keto lifestyle and eventually lost over 250 lbs over a couple of years. now in my 30s i have been diagnosed with osfed atypical anorexia and atypical orthorexia, and over exercising from which i was able to get down to 214 lbs the first time regained to about 268 lbs weight went up and down, then i was able to get to 216 this second relapse. i am in my second recovery period in the past 3 years, with having all of my eds for about 4 or 5 years. in this second recovery i want to be rid of my eds for good this time. i have eliminated exercise minus daily walks those are super casual and not very far or strenuous, intermittent fasting, and caloric restriction. the thing i will not eliminate is keto. i treat sugar and refined carbs as things that i am allergic to that will cause me pain and health issues, because they will push me back to type 2 diabetes and morbid obesity. i have pcos and really bad insulin resistance, and i take hormone medication 10mg of norethindrone where i never have a period. is it ok to continue with keto? hell, i dont monitor my carbs at the moment, i just eat what i want in recovery of keto foods which are naturally high in fat and protein and low in glycemic index. i am probably around 50 net carbs per day though i refuse to count because numbers feed my eds through my ocd. i do not want to go back to the 500 lbs, not so much for the weight itself, but for how pained and miserable i felt for most of my life being that ill. sugar and refined carbohydrates were so toxic to my body. i just need reassurance that continuing to avoid them is not selfsabotage. i dont crave them, feel deprived of them, or feel i need them. following keto for the past 7 years, i can make or buy a keto version of anything that is made from sugar or refined carbs. i actually enjoy the keto versions more upon reflection mostly because the keto versions do not make me feel sick when sugar used to have an immediate negative effect on me. the only thing i can liken this to is for folks with celiac or hashimotos who have to stay away from sugar and gluten so they dont get sick from it. what do you guys think? have any of you ever been through anything like this? i am not promoting extreme weight loss and i am not promoting morbid obesity. both are so very unhealthy, as are the eds that typically lead to both. i am trying to learn and promote body positivity and intuitive eating. lets all try to be happy and healthy and listen to our bodies. ed recovery is one of the hardest things i have ever had to deal with. ill be damned if i have to do it a third time. i dont want anyone else to have to go through it either!",/r/PCOS/comments/15p61b1/keeping_keto_for_pcos_if_even_in_ed_recovery/,1

Is this PCOS?,"hello everyone. i recently got some of my hormone tests results back, and i dont really know what they mean. i was hoping some of you would understand these results and see if it could be pcos or not? my fsh, lh, estradiol, and estrogen levels are low. my testosterone both free and regular are on the higher end of normal freaking out about that. however, the main thing that im concerned about is my dheas level, which was 1696. for some background, i have been suffering from a restrictive eating disorder for about 6 years now, and im actively in recovery. im still undereating, but it is nowhere as bad as before. i lost my period quickly when i started restricting at the very beginning of my ed, and i never got it back. im thinking it might be hypothalamic amenorrhea ha, but some sites say that in malnourished people dhea levels are low. im also a very anxious person, so could this be the reason why its elevated? any answer would be greatly appreciated",/r/PCOS/comments/1jj49ap/elevated_dheas_is_this_pcos/,1

weight & pcos,"content warning weight, eating disorder okay but does anyone have experience with weight loss helping pcos? the follow up question is what tf is the ideal weight for someone with pcos?! when i was diagnosed with pcos at 16 i was at a lowaverage bmi weight. i had a rough battle with ed recovery but my body has seemingly learned how to handle not starving. my lab results have consistently been better than they have in 5 years even from before my diagnosis back when when my bmi weight were lowaverage. currently my weight is at a pretty steady decline for no apparent reason but i digress however it just seems like there is no good news when it comes to pcos. my all of labs are well within normal range im the same height i was at my diagnosis my labs were bad then because of ed related complications but my weight itself was not a risk causing factor at diagnosis. i am now no longer a 16 year old child and do not wish to be the same weight as on but the question remains what tf is the ideal weight for someone with pcos because some of my doctors like my cardiologist and neurologist say bmi is outdated and not an accurate measurement of health and have reassured me my labs dont indicate any weight related concerns but some doctors love to use like its the law. i believe its important to note my breast alone weigh 18lbs and have not gotten even the slightest smaller after losing over 60lbs. so yes 5354 and 190lbs might be a concern some but none of my clothes are plus size anymore not pants or tops my labs are great i look and feel great but everywhere says losing weight helps my obgyn mentions weight loss as management suggestions as part of my aftervist papers but its just a print off from one of the sources the offices uses but no one has ever told me the ideal like what exactly im aiming for weight wise. because if my labs are normal, my body is maintaining itself efficiently, what am i supposed to be achieving with weigh loss??",/r/PCOS/comments/19dk52a/weight_pcos/,1
Metabolism and sustainable weight loss/ED history and advice,"hi there, i am 20f and recentlyish started my pcos treatment journey. i have a family history of pcos, with both my grandmother and mother being very leanalthough my grandmother has an ed, but with polycystic ovaries and high cholesterol, and my mom with hypoglycemiainsulin resistance?. ive always had irregular periods since i started them just before i was 14, but thought it was due to an eating disorder also active, then attributed it to birth controlskipping placebo pills. heads up specific weight and calorie count numbers included below over the course of about 1518 months, i went from 125ish lbs stabilizing after eating disorder recovery to just shy of 185lbs at my highest. i thought at the time the weight gain was due to a combination of antipsychotic medications, smoking, and relationship weight. as with the weight gain, more noticeable pcos symptoms followed apart from irregular periods such as more chin hair, mustache hair, and stomach hair. i felt sluggish and swollen. i felt that despite calorie counting and slightly increasing activity last fall, i was not losing weight as quickly as to be expectedwas still around 170lbs, and was confused. i went to a gyno in early january and was prescribed yaz and metformin. i also take spironolactone, and i have been taking spearmint and inositol and supplementing b12 and d3. i started strength training 34x per week 4590 minutes each session, and seriously cutting out added sugar as much as possible and avoiding a lot more refined carbs and prioritizing protein. this has led to great results! i went from 168170i think? maybe 165?lbs to 153 todayso about 1015lbs in six weeks or so. im building muscle quickly and i am very happy. my goal is somewhere in the neighborhood of 130145lbsim 54, but body composition and symptom management is most important and i dont want to regain the weight. so, whats the problemquestion? well, ive noticed that ive been eating a lot less. im not hungry a lot, and even when i am sometimes i dont find lowcarb options or ive eaten less other days and dont want to mess up progress. most days for the past 2 weeks or so, i drink a 20g low carb 130cal protein shake, eat maybe a snack of some fruit andor nuts, and then usually one lowish carb meal with protein and healthy fats and lots of fruit and veg and lemon water. i dont really count calories as i find generally keeping to 2 or less meals and focusing on macros and vegetables and fruits is enough and i can get very obsessive with numbers, but from a realistic estimate it is likely under 1200 calories on average per day, with a few days definitely dipping in the sub1000 calorie range. this is all well and good, but i am worried about slowing down my metabolism and i am scared to change these habits and undo my hard work. i also want to be careful not to trigger ed thoughts and behaviors and get in a bad mental and physical cycle, but i really want to lose this weight and feel healthy and pretty and i dont want to be too lax. im also worried about slowing down metabolism or not sticking to the plan and regaining the weight, and i want this to be a sustainable lifestyle change. ive noticed it makes social gatherings sometimes more difficult, and while my cravings have thankfully been very merciful and manageable, i want to keep them that way and still have some more typically comfort or enjoyable foods fit in while staying on track. im wondering what i can do to increase my metabolism without gaining weight and still manage pcos symptoms and be able to be socially participate and have a balanced lifestyle? i know it might get progressively to lose the last 1020lbs considering deficit and proportional fat loss and keep my muscle mass up. any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated. thanks!",/r/PCOS/comments/1iqpchs/metabolism_and_sustainable_weight_lossed_history/,1
"26F - Long story but need advice and to vent if anyone cares to read, feeling lost and confused, big question is HRT for amenorrhea safe?","so this is a bit of a lengthy story but looking to see if anyone has any similar issues that has been on hormone replacement therapy at my age or dealt with similar circumstances with gut health, hormone issues and medications. i really need to vent and rant. so this all started last year in december 2021, i went skiing and was taken on an intermediate slope with my now ex bf and his family with no experience. i had no idea what i was doing on a very high slope lost control and immediately crashed and ended up tearing 3 ligaments in my knee. after 2 years together he then attempted to ghost me when we got home and then dumped me via phone 1 week after we got home and we never spoke again. i had reconstructive surgery for aclmeniscus in february of 2022 and have spent the entirety of this year in recoverypt trying to heal my leg, my mind and my heart and now my entire body. the last time i had a period was 2222, the day i went into surgery. ever since then i have not had a period 8 months now and in that 8 months i have developed a plethora of issues and symptoms that led me to finding out about pcos. my hair has been thinningfalling out, my skin has completely freaked out and i have cystic acne that i never had in my life. i bloat to a distended belly 247 with everything i eat or drink and am in constant discomfort. i have gained almost 30 pounds over the course of this year and i cannot lose weight for the life of me. i suffer from chronic migraines to the point of throwing up sometimes. i spoke to my obgyn and she ran some labs, my blood work showed elevated testosterone levels and high cortisol levels and diagnosed me with pcos and wanted me to go on birth control. i was prescribed spironolactone for my acne and testosterone levels which i have been on for 4 months and have had no progress just acne that gets worse and worse, my new doc suggested weaning off of this medication as it has had zero positive effect. i wanted a more holistic approach so i sought out to see dr felice gersh, an obgyn and integrative medicine practice. i saw her pa and we ran even more labs and after reviewing them she doesnt believe i have pcos anymore, but isnt ruling it out entirely. she diagnosed me with hypothalamic amenorrhea, my labs also showed that i have thyroiditis, there are tpo antibodies present in my body and nearing levels of getting a thyroid disease like hypohyperthyroidism. i cant recall exactly what the blood work said but there was something about my free testosterone and fsh levels that she believe indicated opposite of what we would see in pcos patients. additionally i have mthfr gene mutation. i also have high levels of mercury in my body i am not detoxing. she said that what is happening overall is less of a reproductive system ovaries, uterus issue as it is my brain and pituitary gland, which is not sending pulsatory signals to release hormones. my hormone levels are at menopausal levels and she wants me to go on hormone replacement therapy. i will wear a patch of estradiol every day and from days 114 of each month i will take a progesterone. she said i wouldnt get any side effects but i know that with most medications i go on i end up with bad side effects. im a little afraid to go on hrt but i know i need to do something to help my body. has anyone ever experienced amenorrhea and gone on hrt? from what i understand hypothalamic amenorrhea is seen in a lot of people with eating disorders or people who over exercise. i dont believe i fall in either category currently as i have quite a healthy diet and workout consistently i switch off between physical therapy, walking, hot yoga, strength training i am gluten free, dairy free, i eat 3 meals a day with 12 snacks, i avoid inflammatory ingredients and mostly all processed foods with the occasional treat like gluten free baking or gluten free pasta. i eat plenty of fruit veggies and protein and healthy fat. i take vitamins and supplements every day including vitamin d, magnesium, ubiquinol, b12 folate, lglutamine, colostrum, acnutrol for acne, vitamin c, and zinc. but because of my leaky gut i am not absorbing any nutrients. i no longer fit in any of my clothes except a pair of overalls and my leggings. i cant lose weight no matter what i try. i have so much happening and feel so out of control of my body. i have no selfconfidence i am depressed and isolating i cant seem to feel like i can manage my life. i cant wake up in the morning i am exhausted all the time, i have extremely bad brain fog and feel like i have short term memory loss issues. i feel constantly anxious and stressed and i have to figure out how to be less stressed in order to fix these issues but i dont know how. i am really scared i have a pituitary adenoma, a tumor on the pituitary gland as my mom had one develop and went through all these same issues when she was my age. my doctor said it is a possibility and we havent ruled it out but going to try approaching healing in a few other ways before getting an mri. i just hope it isnt a brain tumor. i will say that i have been through quite some trauma in my life...physically and mentally abusive boyfriends, narcissistic abuse, sexual assault, 2 head injuriesconcussions, car crash from being hit by a drunk driver, years of depression and anxiety, sepsis, miscarriage, knee surgery, heartbreak. i get why my body is unwell but it just sucks because after years and years of struggles and hurt and pain i had finally gotten to a point in my life of stability and happiness at the end of 2020 and now it feels like its all being torn away. i feel like all the progress i made is dissipating and im just truly heart broken for myself. on top of that i feel like a crazy person because my hormones are so effed. i go from crying my eyes out to completely fine to hearing a song and crying all over again to laughing at a tv show. i am constantly on the verge of tears for seemingly no reason. i do not see myself when i look in the mirror and i dont feel like myself at all. it seems as if my injury and surgery was a catalyst for setting off all these issues. if anyone has any advice or experience on hormone replacement therapy for young females, weight loss, stress management, leaky gut im all ears. if you read this far i congratulate and thank you, ive never written anything out like this so i appreciate anyone taking the time to read or reply to this.",/r/PCOS/comments/y8c1ms/26f_long_story_but_need_advice_and_to_vent_if/,1

"After years of suspecting, PCOS was confirmed 6/16/25 at my MRI","i want to apologize in advance for how long my rant is! as a precursor i was diagnosed with endometriosis on 31517, at that point i had fought for 3yrs to get a laparoscopy, my period pain had changed drastically after having my son via csection in 2014. ive long suspected that i had pcos, i would double over in pain when i would get sharp pains in my ovaries that would come and go so quickly. after a painful and heart breaking miscarriage 3 in total in sept 2023 i sought out a new ob for a hysterectomy. 21924 is my uterus yeet date my r ovary and fallopian tubes were fused with it and requested they take everything. against my wishes my left ovary was kept in, it looked normal and you need your ovaries since you are under the age of 45 was the explanation i was given. recovery was rough but i got through it. april 2024 i started to feel like my old self, even obtained employee of the month at my job. may and june were good months but i started noticing pain and discomfort on my left side at random times. july 18th, 2 days after my 36th birthday, i was hit with horrendous pain that made me double over. i was shaking and aching all over with body chills. that familiar sharp stabbing pain in my booty hole also returned the flare up lasted for 2wks. i called my ob and thus began a new journey. 815 i finally had a transvaginal ultrasound, they found a cyst the size of a golf ball. they suggested giving it a month to see if it goes away, more pain occured. 926 ultrasound revealed it was the size of grapefruit and full of endoblood. surgery set for 111425. 102224 i ended up in the er with severe constipation from all of the meds i was taking around the clock as ordered by my ob, had to have an enema. surgery was rescheduled to 1115. the day finally arrives, my dr didnt show up until the very last minute, but i was prepped to go. when she arrived she came to see me, told me the plan and kissed my forehead before she left odd asf was finally wheeled back, put under anesthesia. an hour later im coming to, the recovery nurse tells me they could not complete my surgery and my left ovary was still intact. i was told the ovary was embedded into my bowel and i need to see a migs specialist minimally invasive gynecological surgeon i was so angry. the referral is sent, the office calls me to schedule. she has no openings until 51425 and she is a 2hr drive away, im devastated but book it and ask to be on the waitlist for any openings. 1225 i end up in the er after having so many bowel issues and blood in my stool. a ct is done that shows the ovary is still embedded in my bowel but i have no gi bleeds and im diagnosed with a hemrhoid the next 6 months are agony, but thankfully i extended my fmla. no openings came up, may rolls around, i go and meet her. she is so nice and caring, she asked for every detail of this journey that started in 2014 after having my son via csection. we both agree surgery is needed and i ask for an mri to be done first. 6125 is the scheduled mri at my local hospital network, the system gets hacked on 52025 so my appt gets cancelled while they sort things out. i schedule 2hrs away with the new network my specialist is from for 61325. in the time of waiting the ovary is in a flare up and im in agony. the hacked hospital network calls to reschedule for 616, i take it to avoid the 2hr drive. the day finally arrives, i undergo it and wait. mychart results come in that night, pcos is confirmed as i always suspected. 620 i have a virtual appt with my specialist, we agree surgery is needed, she wants me on gabbapentin until then. monday 623 her office will call me to schedule it. why did i have to go thru all of that to get to this point? why didnt they do an mri before the hysterectomy, it would have savede so much time. just why? why is everything so f.cked up in order to get help?",/r/PCOS/comments/1lh5vcf/after_years_of_suspecting_pcos_was_confirmed/,1

(20F) My acne flared on a levonorgestrel combined pill; does this indicate PCOS?,"hi all, i would be extremely grateful for your adviceopinions on my condition. i am aware that it is dangerous and ridiculous to diagnose myself with anything on the advice of strangers over the internet but would be interested if others have suffered something similar. i have never been formally diagnosed with pcos though doctors have suspected it because every time i have had blood tests, the out of whack levels have always been put down to my anorexia and recovery. my irregular periods has also been put down to this and earlier in my life, just down to my age. so what im really asking is if it is normal for acne to flare in a woman without pcos when taking a combined pill containing levonorgestrel, or whether this is another piece of evidence i can add to my attempt to understand the root cause of my relentless acne. xxxxx",/r/PCOS/comments/gktt1e/20f_my_acne_flared_on_a_levonorgestrel_combined/,1
Diet and DIM Supplement.,"does anyone else find doing research very very very frustrating when it comes to trying to help yourself balance your own hormones? for example, you will go to one site which tells you to eat protein and then you go to another and see this. a high protein diet causes a decrease in the production of sex hormone binding globulin shbg, which is vital to reducing testosterone levels something thats critical in pcos recovery. also, i dont know if im oestrogen dominant or low, so i dont even know whether to avoid phytoestrogens in foods or not. but i decided to look up foods high in them just in case and is it just me, but nearly every healthy food contains phytoestrogens. like am i supposed to just live on three carrots a day for the rest of my life?! its ridiculous, even researching leaves you stressed out which does not help your pcos. anyway, during my researching, ive found a supplement called dim. which im also getting conflicting theories that it releases extra free testosterone in the body whilst helping with the oestrogen and progesterone balance and some say it doesnt cause testosterone effects at all and actually has antiandrogen effects. has anyone else heard about this or know of it and is anyone here taking dim and found it helps? are the rest of you concerned about eating too many foods which contain phytoestrogens or do you just stick to a low carb and no sugar diet? im really interested to know what a lot of you eat or dont eat that you have found to be helpful or beneficial? im feeling so done with this most days where i just cry and feel like ive had enough and then i have days where i want to fight this and do what i can to help and heal my body. thank you for reading this far and any information will be really appreciated! edit i need to ask so many questions when i see my endo, but does anyone know here that if my lh ratio is double my fsh, does this mean im not actually low on progesterone?",/r/PCOS/comments/98k3fw/diet_and_dim_supplement/,1
Low estrogen level and brain fog,"in my 20s, ive always had low estrogen level with peak at 60pgml basically whats expected at the beginning of your cycle or so. i have lean pcos and anovulatory x200b recently, ive done a round of egg freezing, and due to the stimulation med, and being pcos having large number of follicles, my estrogen level kept going up all the way to 12000pgml! as follicles started to grow. the egg stimulation phase is supposed to be somewhat uncomfortable time for a lot of people, with bloating, and other side effects. but i really felt a boost in my energy level and boost during the period, pretty immediately, after i started injecting follicle growth hormones. x200b i saw myself easily smiling, being anxious about thing way less, less brain fog, being able to focus, remain calm, lots of energy.... x200b egg freezingretrieval is very involvedexpensive and invasive procedure, so im not encouraging anyone to do this just for this hormonal experience, but i wanted to share my anecdotefinding. please share if you have any similar experiencefinding. x200b after the egg retrieval, and some recovery time, im my estrogen level is back to where it was, and my restlessnessanxiousness came back. i do feel like ive been missing out whole a lot in the past decade by having chronic low estrogen level",/r/PCOS/comments/wpk6ik/low_estrogen_level_and_brain_fog/,1
